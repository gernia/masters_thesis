	abstract = {Machine learning has immense novel but also disruptive potential for medicine. Numerous applications have already been suggested and evaluated concerning cardiovascular diseases. One important aspect is the detection and management of potentially thrombogenic arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation. While atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia with a lifetime risk of one in three persons and an increased risk of thromboembolic complications such as stroke, many atrial fibrillation episodes are asymptomatic and a first diagnosis is oftentimes only reached after an embolic event. Therefore, screening for atrial fibrillation represents an important part of clinical practice. Novel technologies such as machine learning have the potential to substantially improve patient care and clinical outcomes. Additionally, machine learning applications may aid cardiologists in the management of patients with already diagnosed atrial fibrillation, for example, by identifying patients at a high risk of recurrence after catheter ablation. We summarize the current state of evidence concerning machine learning and, in particular, artificial neural networks in the detection and management of atrial fibrillation and describe possible future areas of development as well as pitfalls. Typical data flow in machine learning applications for atrial fibrillation detection.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence ({AI}) has given the electrocardiogram ({ECG}) and clinicians reading them super-human diagnostic abilities. Trained without hard-coded rules by finding often subclinical patterns in huge datasets, {AI} transforms the {ECG}, a ubiquitous, non-invasive cardiac test that is integrated into practice workflows, into a screening tool and predictor of cardiac and non-cardiac diseases, often in asymptomatic individuals. This review describes the mathematical background behind supervised {AI} algorithms, and discusses selected {AI} {ECG} cardiac screening algorithms including those for the detection of left ventricular dysfunction, episodic atrial fibrillation from a tracing recorded during normal sinus rhythm, and other structural and valvular diseases. The ability to learn from big data sets, without the need to understand the biological mechanism, has created opportunities for detecting non-cardiac diseases as {COVID}-19 and introduced challenges with regards to data privacy. Like all medical tests, the {AI} {ECG} must be carefully vetted and validated in real-world clinical environments. Finally, with mobile form factors that allow acquisition of medical-grade {ECGs} from smartphones and wearables, the use of {AI} may enable massive scalability to democratize healthcare.},

	abstract = {While fundamental aspects of the application of artificial intelligence ({AI}) to electrocardiogram ({ECG}) analysis were discussed in part 1 of this review, the present work (part 2) provides a review of recent studies on the practical application of this new technology. The number of published articles on the topic of {AI}-based {ECG} analysis has been increasing rapidly since 2017. This is especially true for studies that use deep learning ({DL}) with artificial neural networks. The aim is not only to overcome the weaknesses of classical {ECG} diagnostics, but also to extend the functionality of the {ECG}. This involves the detection of cardiological and noncardiological diseases and the prediction for clinical events, e.g., the future development of left ventricular dysfunction and future clinical manifestation of atrial fibrillation. This is made possible by {AI} using {DL} to find subclinical patterns in giant {ECG} datasets and using them for algorithm development. {AI}-assisted {ECG} analysis is becoming a screening tool; it goes far beyond just being "better" than a cardiologist. The progress that has been made is remarkable and is generating much attention and also euphoria among experts and the public. However, most studies are proof-of-concept studies. Often, private (institution-owned) data are used, the quality of which is unclear. To date, clinical validation of the developed algorithms in other collectives and scenarios has been rare. Particularly problematic is that the way {AI} finds a solution so far mostly remains hidden from humans (black-box character of {AI}). Overall, {AI}-based electrocardiography is still in its infancy. However, it is already foreseeable that the {ECG}, as a diagnostic procedure that is easy to use and can be repeated as often as desired, will not only continue to be indispensable in the future, but will also gain in clinical importance.},

	abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases ({CVDs}) are one of the most fatal disease groups worldwide. Electrocardiogram ({ECG}) is a widely used tool for automatically detecting cardiac abnormalities, thereby helping to control and manage {CVDs}. To encourage more multidisciplinary researches, {PhysioNet}/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2020 (Challenge 2020) provided a public platform involving multi-center databases and automatic evaluations for {ECG} classification tasks. As a result, 41 teams successfully submitted their solutions and were qualified for rankings. Although Challenge 2020 was a success, there has been no in-depth methodological meta-analysis of these solutions, making it difficult for researchers to benefit from the solutions and results. In this study, we aim to systematically review the 41 solutions in terms of data processing, feature engineering, model architecture, and training strategy. For each perspective, we visualize and statistically analyze the effectiveness of the common techniques, and discuss the methodological advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we summarize five practical lessons based on the aforementioned analysis: (1) Data augmentation should be employed and adapted to specific scenarios; (2) Combining different features can improve performance; (3) A hybrid design of different types of deep neural networks ({DNNs}) is better than using a single type; (4) The use of end-to-end architectures should depend on the task being solved; (5) Multiple models are better than one. We expect that our meta-analysis will help accelerate the research related to {ECG} classification based on machine-learning models.},

            The role of automatic electrocardiogram ({ECG}) analysis in clinical practice is limited by the accuracy of existing models. Deep Neural Networks ({DNNs}) are models composed of stacked transformations that learn tasks by examples. This technology has recently achieved striking success in a variety of task and there are great expectations on how it might improve clinical practice. Here we present a {DNN} model trained in a dataset with more than 2 million labeled exams analyzed by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais and collected under the scope of the {CODE} (Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiology) study. The {DNN} outperform cardiology resident medical doctors in recognizing 6 types of abnormalities in 12-lead {ECG} recordings, with F1 scores above 80\% and specificity over 99\%. These results indicate {ECG} analysis based on {DNNs}, previously studied in a single-lead setup, generalizes well to 12-lead exams, taking the technology closer to the standard clinical practice.},

Automated electrocardiogram ({ECG}) analysis can support clinicians to identify abnormal excitation of the heart and prevent premature cardiovascular death. An explainable classification is particularly important for support systems. Our contribution to the {PhysioNet}/{CinC} Challenge 2021 (team name: {ibmtPeakyFinders}) therefore pursues an approach that is based on interpretable features to be as explainable as possible. To meet the challenge goal of developing an algorithm that works for both 12-lead and reduced lead {ECGs}, we processed each lead separately. We focused on signal processing techniques based on template delineation that yield the template's fiducial points to take the {ECG} waveform morphology into account. In addition to beat intervals and amplitudes obtained from the template, various heart rate variability and {QT} interval variability features were extracted and supplemented by signal quality indices. Our classification approach utilized a decision tree ensemble in a one-vs-rest approach. The model parameters were determined using an extensive grid search. Our approach achieved challenge scores of 0.47, 0.47, 0.34, 0.40, and 0.41 on hidden 12-, 6-, 3-, 4-, and 2-lead test sets, respectively, which corresponds to the ranks 12, 10, 23, 18, and 16 out of 39 teams.},

The method comprises preprocessing estimation of the dominant atrial frequency for the purpose of controlling the subbands of a filter bank, computation of the relative subband (harmonics) energy, and the subband sample entropy. Using minimum-error-rate classification of different feature vectors, a data set consisting of 24-h ambulatory recordings from 50 subjects with either paroxysmal (26) or persistent (24) atrial fibrillation ({AF}) was analyzed on a 10-s segment basis; a total of 212,196 segments were classified. The best performance in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was obtained for a feature vector defined by the subband sample entropy of the dominant atrial frequency and the relative harmonics energy, resulting in a value of 0.923, whereas that of the dominant atrial frequency was equal to 0.826. It is concluded that paroxysmal and persistent {AFs} can be discriminated from short segments with good accuracy at any time of an ambulatory recording.},

	abstract = {Atrial fibrillation ({AF}) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and entails an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Prediction of the termination of an {AF} episode, based on noninvasive techniques, can benefit patients, doctors and health systems. The method described in this paper is based on two-lead surface electrocardiograms ({ECGs}): 1-min {ECG} recordings of {AF} episodes including N-type (not terminating within an hour after the end of the record), S-type (terminating 1 min after the end of the record) and T-type (terminating immediately after the end of the record). These records are organised into three learning sets (N, S and T) and two test sets (A and B). Starting from these {ECGs}, the atrial and ventricular activities were separated using beat classification and class averaged beat subtraction, followed by the evaluation of seven parameters representing atrial or ventricular activity. Stepwise discriminant analysis selected the set including dominant atrial frequency ({DAF}, index of atrial activity) and average {HR} ({HRmean}, index of ventricular activity) as optimal for discrimination between N/T-type episodes. The linear classifier, estimated on the 20 cases of the N and T learning sets, provided a performance of 90\% on the 30 cases of a test set for the N/T-type discrimination. The same classifier led to correct classification in 89\% of the 46 cases for N/S-type discrimination. The method has shown good results and seems to be suitable for clinical application, although a larger dataset would be very useful for improvement and validation of the algorithms and the development of an earlier predictor of paroxysmal {AF} spontaneous termination time.},

	abstract = {Automatic detection of atrial fibrillation ({AF}) for {AF} diagnosis, especially for {AF} monitoring, is necessarily desirable for clinical therapy. In this study, we proposed a novel method for detection of the transition between {AF} and sinus rhythm based on {RR} intervals. First, we obtained the delta {RR} interval distri bution difference curve from the density histogram of delta {RR} intervals, and then detected its peaks, which represented the {AF} events. Once an {AF} event was detected, four successive steps were used to classify its type, and thus, determine the boundary of {AF}: 1) histogram analysis; 2) standard deviation analysis; 3) numbering aberrant rhythms recognition; and 4) Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test. A dataset of 24-h Holter {ECG} recordings (n = 433) and two {MIT}-{BIH} databases ({MIT}-{BIH} {AF} database and {MIT}-{BIH} nor mal sinus rhythm ({NSR}) database) were used for development and evaluation. Using the receiver operating characteristic curves for determining the threshold of the K-S test, we have achieved the highest performance of sensitivity and specificity ({SP}) (96.1\% and 98.1\%, respectively) for the {MIT}-{BIH} {AF} database, compared with other previously published algorithms. The {SP} was 97.9\% for the {MIT}-{BIH} {NSR} database.},

The method categorises an {ECG} recording into one of four categories: normal, {AF}, other and noisy rhythm. For training the classification model, 8528 scored {ECG} signals were used; for independent performance assessment, 3658 scored {ECG} signals. Approach: Our method was based on features derived from {RR} interbeat intervals. The features included time domain, frequency domain and distribution features. We assessed the performance of three different classifiers (linear and quadratic discriminant analysis, and quadratic neural network ({QNN})) on the training set using 100-fold cross-validation. The {QNN} was selected as the highest performing classifier, and a further performance assessment on the test data made. Main results: On the test set, our method achieved an F1 score for the normal, {AF}, other and noisy classes of 0.90, 0.75, 0.68 and 0.32, respectively. The overall F1 score was 0.78. Significance: The computational cost of our algorithm is low as all features are derived from {RR} intervals and are processed by a single hidden layer neural network.

Moreover, since {AF} is caused by heterogeneous mechanisms in different patients, as we demonstrate in this paper, a patient-specific approach offers a promising solution. In this work, we consider two {ECG} recordings, one close to {PAF} onset and one far away from any {PAF} episode. For each patient, we extract two 5-minute {ECG} segments approximately 20 minutes apart. Next, we train a linear Support Vector Machine ({SVM}) classifier using patient-specific sets of time- and amplitude-domain features.

	doi = {10.7243/2053-7662-4-8},
	abstract = {In this research article, we apply clustering within the Symbolic Pattern Recognition ({SPR}) framework to problems related to classifying different clinical categories of atrial fibrillation by modeling the changes in electrical activity of the heart. {SPR} characterizes a sequential dataset by modeling the transition behavior exhibited by patterns of symbols; clearly, this technique requires continuous data to be discretized into a set of defined symbols. With {SPR}, we were able to find hidden patterns in electrocardiograms ({ECG}) recorded during normal sinus rhythm that allowed us to classify patients as having paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ({PAF}) vs. those that did not. Even without extensive tuning of the model, our correct classification rate of 80\% is inline with other published models. Additionally, we were able to identify normal sinus rhythm {ECGs} of {PAF} patients when a {PAF} episode was imminent. Finally, we used {SPR} clustering to distinguish between episodes of atrial fibrillation which would end within one minute (spontaneously-terminating) vs. those which needed intervention to stabilize (sustained). These are very important considerations for clinical practitioners for several reasons. The ability to screen for, and diagnose, {PAF} even with no known history or ongoing episode would be invaluable. This is especially true as related to elderly patients whom are at greater risk from atrial fibrillation, many of whom undergo regular {ECG} screenings anyway. Secondly, early warning that a {PAF} episode is imminent can give caregivers the chance to prepare an appropriate intervention in advance. For certain patients, this could mean the difference between life and death. Lastly, it is recognized that intervention to stabilize atrial fibrillation is not always in the best interest in the patient. One consideration is how long the episode is expected to last; in many cases, it may be better to allow an episode to spontaneously terminate.},

The focus is on patient screening and identifying patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ({PAF}), which represents a life threatening cardiac arrhythmia. The proposed approach operates with a large volume of raw {ECG} time-series data as inputs to a deep convolutional neural networks ({CNN}). It autonomously learns representative and key features of the {PAF} to be used by a classification module. The features are therefore learned directly from the large time domain {ECG} signals by using a {CNN} with one fully connected layer. The learned features can effectively replace the traditional ad hoc and time-consuming user's hand-crafted features. Our experimental results verify and validate the effectiveness and capabilities of the learned features for {PAF} patient screening. The main advantages of our proposed approach are to simplify the feature extraction process corresponding to different cardiac arrhythmias and to remove the need for using a human expert to define appropriate and critical features working with a large time-series data set. The extensive simulations and case studies conducted indicate that combining the learned features with other classifiers will significantly improve the performance of the patient screening system as compared to an end-to-end {CNN} classifier. The effectiveness and capabilities of our proposed {ECG} {DL} classification machine is demonstrated and quantitative comparisons with several conventional machine learning classifiers are also provided.},

	abstract = {Atrial fibrillation ({AF}), the most frequent cause of cardioembolic stroke, is increasing in prevalence as the population ages, and presents with a broad spectrum of symptoms and severity. The early identification of {AF} is an essential part for preventing the possibility of blood clotting and stroke. In this work, a real-time algorithm is proposed for accurately screening {AF} episodes in electrocardiograms. This method adopts heart rate sequence, and it involves the application of symbolic dynamics and Shannon entropy. Using novel recursive algorithms, a low-computational complexity can be obtained. Four publicly-accessible sets of clinical data (Long-Term {AF}, {MIT}-{BIH} {AF}, {MIT}-{BIH} Arrhythmia, and {MIT}-{BIH} Normal Sinus Rhythm Databases) were used for assessment. The first database was selected as a training set; the receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) curve was performed, and the best performance was achieved at the threshold of 0.639: the sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value ({PPV}) and overall accuracy ({ACC}) were 96.14\%, 95.73\%, 97.03\% and 95.97\%, respectively. The other three databases were used for independent testing. Using the obtained decision-making threshold (i.e., 0.639), for the second set, the obtained parameters were 97.37\%, 98.44\%, 97.89\% and 97.99\%, respectively; for the third database, these parameters were 97.83\%, 87.41\%, 47.67\% and 88.51\%, respectively; the Sp was 99.68\% for the fourth set. The latest methods were also employed for comparison. Collectively, results presented in this study indicate that the combination of symbolic dynamics and Shannon entropy yields a potent {AF} detector, and suggest this method could be of practical use in both clinical and out-of-clinical settings.},

	abstract = {In this paper, an effective paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ({PAF}) prediction algorithm is presented, which is based on analysis of the heart rate variability ({HRV}) signal. The proposed method consists of a preprocessing step for {QRS} detection and {HRV} signal extraction. In the next step, several features which can be used as markers for the prediction of {PAF} are extracted from the {HRV} signal. These features consist of spectrum features, bispectrum features, and non-linear features including sample entropy and Poincaré plot-extracted features. The spectrum features are able to discriminate the sympathetic and parasympathetic contents of the {HRV} signal, which are affected before {PAF} attacks. The bispectrum features are used in order to reveal information not presented on the spectral domain, and to detect quadratic phase coupled harmonics arising from non-linearities of the {HRV} signal. Moreover, the non-linear analysis can map the heart rate irregularities in the feature space and it leads to better understanding of the system dynamics before {PAF} attacks. In the final step, a support vector machine ({SVM})-based classifier has been used for {PAF} prediction. The performance of the proposed method in prediction of {PAF} episodes was evaluated using the Atrial Fibrillation Prediction Database ({AFPDB}). The obtained sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictivity were 96.30\%, 93.10\%, and 92.86\%, respectively. The proposed methodology presents better results than the other existing approaches. The other important advantage of the proposed method when compared to the other approaches is that we do not need the both records of a subject to specify which episode preceding {PAF} events.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Atrial fibrillation ({AF}) is the most common cardiac arrhythmias causing morbidity and mortality. {AF} may appear as episodes of very short (i.e., proximal {AF}) or sustained duration (i.e., persistent {AF}), either form of which causes irregular ventricular excitations that affect the global function of the heart. It is an unmet challenge for early and automatic detection of {AF}, limiting efficient treatment strategies for {AF}. In this study, we developed a new method based on continuous wavelet transform and 2D convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) to detect {AF} episodes. The proposed method analyzed the time-frequency features of the electrocardiogram ({ECG}), thus being different to conventional {AF} detecting methods that implement isolating atrial or ventricular activities. Then a 2D {CNN} was trained to improve {AF} detection performance. The {MIT}-{BIH} Atrial Fibrillation Database was used for evaluating the algorithm. The efficacy of the proposed method was compared with those of some existing methods, most of which implemented the same dataset. The newly developed algorithm using {CNNs} achieved 99.41, 98.91, 99.39, and 99.23\% for the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and overall accuracy ({ACC}) respectively.

	abstract = {Background
Atrial fibrillation ({AF}) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, and a major public health burden associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Automatic detection of {AF} could substantially help in early diagnosis, management and consequently prevention of the complications associated with chronic {AF}. In this paper, we propose a novel method for automatic {AF} detection.
Method
Stationary wavelet transform and support vector machine have been employed to detect {AF} episodes. The proposed method eliminates the need for P-peak or R-Peak detection (a pre-processing step required by many existing algorithms), and hence its performance (sensitivity, specificity) does not depend on the performance of beat detection. The proposed method has been compared with those of the existing methods in terms of various measures including performance, transition time (detection delay associated with transitioning from a non-{AF} to {AF} episode), and computation time (using {MIT}-{BIH} Atrial Fibrillation database).
Results
Results of a stratified 2-fold cross-validation reveals that the area under the Receiver Operative Characteristics ({ROC}) curve of the proposed method is 99.5\%. Moreover, the method maintains its high accuracy regardless of the choice of the parameters׳ values and even for data segments as short as 10s. Using the optimal values of the parameters, the method achieves sensitivity and specificity of 97.0\% and 97.1\%, respectively.
Discussion
The proposed {AF} detection method has high sensitivity and specificity, and holds several interesting properties which make it a suitable choice for practical applications.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Early detection and intervention of atrial fibrillation ({AF}) is a cornerstone for effective treatment and prevention of mortality. Diverse deep learning models ({DLMs}) have been developed, but they could not be applied in clinical practice owing to their lack of interpretability. We developed an explainable {DLM} to detect {AF} using {ECG} and validated its performance using diverse formats of {ECG}.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective study. The Sejong {ECG} dataset comprising 128,399 {ECGs} was used to develop and internally validated the explainable {DLM}. {DLM} was developed with two feature modules, which could describe the reason for {DLM} decisions. {DLM} was external validated using data from 21,837, 10,605, and 8528 {ECGs} from {PTB}-{XL}, Chapman, and {PhysioNet} non-restricted datasets, respectively. The predictor variables were digitally stored {ECGs}, and the endpoints were {AFs}.
Results
During internal and external validation of the {DLM}, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves ({AUCs}) of the {DLM} using a 12‑lead {ECG} in detecting {AF} were 0.997–0.999. The {AUCs} of the {DLM} with {VAE} using a 6‑lead and single‑lead {ECG} were 0.990–0.999. The {AUCs} of explainability about features such as rhythm irregularity and absence of P-wave were 0.961–0.993 and 0.983–0.993, respectively.
Conclusions
Our {DLM} successfully detected {AF} using diverse {ECGs} and described the reason for this decision. The results indicated that an explainable artificial intelligence methodology could be adopted to the {DLM} using {ECG} and enhance the transparency of the {DLM} for its application in clinical practice.},

Methods We trained a deep convolutional neural network ({DCNN}) to detect {AF} in 17 s {PPG} waveforms using a training data set of 149 048 {PPG} waveforms constructed from several publicly available {PPG} databases. The {DCNN} was validated using an independent test data set of 3039 smartphone-acquired {PPG} waveforms from adults at high risk of {AF} at a general outpatient clinic against {ECG} tracings reviewed by two cardiologists.

	doi = {10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.047829},
	abstract = {Background:

Atrial fibrillation ({AF}) is associated with substantial morbidity, especially when it goes undetected. If new-onset {AF} could be predicted, targeted screening could be used to find it early. We hypothesized that a deep neural network could predict new-onset {AF} from the resting 12-lead {ECG} and that this prediction may help identify those at risk of {AF}-related stroke.

Methods:

We used 1.6 M resting 12-lead digital {ECG} traces from 430 000 patients collected from 1984 to 2019. Deep neural networks were trained to predict new-onset {AF} (within 1 year) in patients without a history of {AF}. Performance was evaluated using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve and precision-recall curve. We performed an incidence-free survival analysis for a period of 30 years following the {ECG} stratified by model predictions. To simulate real-world deployment, we trained a separate model using all {ECGs} before 2010 and evaluated model performance on a test set of {ECGs} from 2010 through 2014 that were linked to our stroke registry. We identified the patients at risk for {AF}-related stroke among those predicted to be high risk for {AF} by the model at different prediction thresholds.

Results:

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the precision-recall curve were 0.85 and 0.22, respectively, for predicting new-onset {AF} within 1 year of an {ECG}. The hazard ratio for the predicted high- versus low-risk groups over a 30-year span was 7.2 (95\% {CI}, 6.9–7.6). In a simulated deployment scenario, the model predicted new-onset {AF} at 1 year with a sensitivity of 69\% and specificity of 81\%. The number needed to screen to find 1 new case of {AF} was 9. This model predicted patients at high risk for new-onset {AF} in 62\% of all patients who experienced an {AF}-related stroke within 3 years of the index {ECG}.

Conclusions:

Deep learning can predict new-onset {AF} from the 12-lead {ECG} in patients with no previous history of {AF}. This prediction may help identify patients at risk for {AF}-related strokes.},

	abstract = {Atrial fibrillation ({AF}) affects 34 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of stroke. A readily accessible means to continuously monitor for {AF} could prevent large numbers of strokes and death.To develop and validate a deep neural network to detect {AF} using smartwatch data.In this multinational cardiovascular remote cohort study coordinated at the University of California, San Francisco, smartwatches were used to obtain heart rate and step count data for algorithm development. A total of 9750 participants enrolled in the Health {eHeart} Study and 51 patients undergoing cardioversion at the University of California, San Francisco, were enrolled between February 2016 and March 2017. A deep neural network was trained using a method called heuristic pretraining in which the network approximated representations of the R-R interval (ie, time between heartbeats) without manual labeling of training data. Validation was performed against the reference standard 12-lead electrocardiography ({ECG}) in a separate cohort of patients undergoing cardioversion. A second exploratory validation was performed using smartwatch data from ambulatory individuals against the reference standard of self-reported history of persistent {AF}. Data were analyzed from March 2017 to September 2017.The sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic C statistic for the algorithm to detect {AF} were generated based on the reference standard of 12-lead {ECG}–diagnosed {AF}.Of the 9750 participants enrolled in the remote cohort, including 347 participants with {AF}, 6143 (63.0\%) were male, and the mean ({SD}) age was 42 (12) years.

	abstract = {Atrial fibrillation ({AF}) affects 34 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of stroke. A readily accessible means to continuously monitor for {AF} could prevent large numbers of strokes and death.To develop and validate a deep neural network to detect {AF} using smartwatch data.In this multinational cardiovascular remote cohort study coordinated at the University of California, San Francisco, smartwatches were used to obtain heart rate and step count data for algorithm development. A total of 9750 participants enrolled in the Health {eHeart} Study and 51 patients undergoing cardioversion at the University of California, San Francisco, were enrolled between February 2016 and March 2017. A deep neural network was trained using a method called heuristic pretraining in which the network approximated representations of the R-R interval (ie, time between heartbeats) without manual labeling of training data. Validation was performed against the reference standard 12-lead electrocardiography ({ECG}) in a separate cohort of patients undergoing cardioversion. A second exploratory validation was performed using smartwatch data from ambulatory individuals against the reference standard of self-reported history of persistent {AF}. Data were analyzed from March 2017 to September 2017.The sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic C statistic for the algorithm to detect {AF} were generated based on the reference standard of 12-lead {ECG}–diagnosed {AF}.Of the 9750 participants enrolled in the remote cohort, including 347 participants with {AF}, 6143 (63.0\%) were male, and the mean ({SD}) age was 42 (12) years.

          Deep learning-based methods have demonstrated high classification performance in the detection of cardiovascular diseases from electrocardiograms ({ECGs}). However, their blackbox character and the associated lack of interpretability limit their clinical applicability. To overcome existing limitations, we present a novel deep learning architecture for interpretable {ECG} analysis ({xECGArch}). For the first time, short- and long-term features are analyzed by two independent convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) and combined into an ensemble, which is extended by methods of explainable artificial intelligence ({xAI}) to whiten the blackbox. To demonstrate the trustworthiness of {xECGArch}, perturbation analysis was used to compare 13 different {xAI} methods. We parameterized {xECGArch} for atrial fibrillation ({AF}) detection using four public {ECG} databases (n = 9,854 {ECGs}) and achieved an F1 score of 95.43 \% in {AF} versus non-{AF} classification on an unseen {ECG} test dataset. A systematic comparison of {xAI} methods showed that deep Taylor decomposition provided the most trustworthy explanations (+24 \% compared to the second-best approach). {xECGArch} can account for short- and long-term features corresponding to clinical features of morphology and rhythm, respectively. Further research will focus on the relationship between {xECGArch} features and clinical features, which may help in medical applications for diagnosis and therapy.},

	abstract = {Background—

The global burden of atrial fibrillation ({AF}) is unknown.

Methods and Results—

We systematically reviewed population-based studies of {AF} published from 1980 to 2010 from the 21 Global Burden of Disease regions to estimate global/regional prevalence, incidence, and morbidity and mortality related to {AF} ({DisModMR} software). Of 377 potential studies identified, 184 met prespecified eligibility criteria. The estimated number of individuals with {AF} globally in 2010 was 33.5 million (20.9 million men [95\% uncertainty interval ({UI}), 19.5–22.2 million] and 12.6 million women [95\% {UI}, 12.0–13.7 million]). Burden associated with {AF}, measured as disability-adjusted life-years, increased by 18.8\% (95\% {UI}, 15.8–19.3) in men and 18.9\% (95\% {UI}, 15.8–23.5) in women from 1990 to 2010. In 1990, the estimated age-adjusted prevalence rates of {AF} (per 100 000 population) were 569.5 in men (95\% {UI}, 532.8–612.7) and 359.9 in women (95\% {UI}, 334.7–392.6); the estimated age-adjusted incidence rates were 60.7 per 100 000 person-years in men (95\% {UI}, 49.2–78.5) and 43.8 in women (95\% {UI}, 35.9–55.0). In 2010, the prevalence rates increased to 596.2 (95\% {UI}, 558.4–636.7) in men and 373.1 (95\% {UI}, 347.9–402.2) in women; the incidence rates increased to 77.5 (95\% {UI}, 65.2–95.4) in men and 59.5 (95\% {UI}, 49.9–74.9) in women. Mortality associated with {AF} was higher in women and increased by 2-fold (95\% {UI}, 2.0–2.2) and 1.9-fold (95\% {UI}, 1.8–2.0) in men and women, respectively, from 1990 to 2010. There was evidence of significant regional heterogeneity in {AF} estimations and availability of population-based data.

Conclusions—

These findings provide evidence of progressive increases in overall burden, incidence, prevalence, and {AF}-associated mortality between 1990 and 2010, with significant public health implications. Systematic, regional surveillance of {AF} is required to better direct prevention and treatment strategies.},

	abstract = {Objective To assess the accuracy of general practitioners, practice nurses, and interpretative software in the use of different types of electrocardiogram to diagnose atrial fibrillation.
Design Prospective comparison with reference standard of assessment of electrocardiograms by two independent specialists.
Setting 49 general practices in central England.
Participants 2595 patients aged 65 or over screened for atrial fibrillation as part of the screening for atrial fibrillation in the elderly ({SAFE}) study; 49 general practitioners and 49 practice nurses.
Interventions All electrocardiograms were read with the Biolog interpretative software, and a random sample of 12 lead, limb lead, and single lead thoracic placement electrocardiograms were assessed by general practitioners and practice nurses independently of each other and of the Biolog assessment.
Main outcome measures Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values.
Results General practitioners detected 79 out of 99 cases of atrial fibrillation on a 12 lead electrocardiogram (sensitivity 80\%, 95\% confidence interval 71\% to 87\%) and misinterpreted 114 out of 1355 cases of sinus rhythm as atrial fibrillation (specificity 92\%, 90\% to 93\%). Practice nurses detected a similar proportion of cases of atrial fibrillation (sensitivity 77\%, 67\% to 85\%), but had a lower specificity (85\%, 83\% to 87\%). The interpretative software was significantly more accurate, with a specificity of 99\%, but missed 36 of 215 cases of atrial fibrillation (sensitivity 83\%). Combining general practitioners' interpretation with the interpretative software led to a sensitivity of 92\% and a specificity of 91\%. Use of limb lead or single lead thoracic placement electrocardiograms resulted in some loss of specificity.
Conclusions Many primary care professionals cannot accurately detect atrial fibrillation on an electrocardiogram, and interpretative software is not sufficiently accurate to circumvent this problem, even when combined with interpretation by a general practitioner. Diagnosis of atrial fibrillation in the community needs to factor in the reading of electrocardiograms by appropriately trained people.},

	abstract = {Sympathovagal imbalance is known to precede the on-set of atrial fibrillation ({AF}) and has been analyzed extensively based on heart rate variability ({HRV}). However, the relationship between sympathetic and vagal effects before {AF} onset and their influence on various {HRV} features have not been fully elucidated. {QT} interval variability ({QTV}) reflects sympathetic activity and may therefore provide further insights into this relationship. Using the time delay stability ({TDS}) method, we investigated temporal changes in coupling behavior before {AF} onset between 20 vagal or sympathovagal-associated {HRV} and {QTV} features. We applied the {TDS} method to 26 electrocardiograms from the {MIT}-{BIH} {AF} database with at least one hour of sinus rhythm preceding {AF} onset. Sinus rhythm segments were split into 5-minute windows with 50 \% overlap. Logistic regression analysis revealed significantly (p {\textless} 0.01) increased coupling between {QTV} and vagal {HRV} features from 20 to 15 minutes before {AF} onset. We found similar behavior between {QTV} and sympathovagal {HRV} features. This indicates sympathetic predominance increasing until 15 minutes before the onset of {AF} and decreasing towards vagal predominance right before {AF} onset. Our results provide new insights into temporal changes of sympathovagal imbalance preceding {AF} onset and may improve the prediction of {AF} in clinical applications.},

	shorttitle = {Heart rate variability in atrial fibrillation},
	abstract = {Background Atrial fibrillation ({AF}) is the commonest abnormal heart rhythm with significant related morbidity and mortality. Several pathophysiologic mechanisms have been advocated to explain the onset of {AF}. There has been increasing evidence that abnormalities of the autonomic nervous system ({ANS}) that includes sympathetic, parasympathetic and intrinsic neural network are involved in the pathogenesis of {AF}. This review will consider the anatomical and pathophysiological concepts of the cardiac neuronal network and discuss how it can be investigated. Design Relevant articles for this review were selected primarily from Ovid Medline and Embase databases (see appendix). We searched for key terms “atrial fibrillation,” “{AF},” “autonomic dysfunction,” “autonomic nervous system,” “heart rate variability” and “{HRV}” to gather relevant studies. Duplicate papers were excluded. Results Heart is richly innervated by autonomic nerves. Both sympathetic and parasympathetic systems interact in developing {AF} along with cardiac ganglionated plexi ({GP}). Thus autonomic dysfunction is present in {AF}. There are methods including selective ablation that reduce autonomic innervation and show to reduce the incidence of spontaneous or induced atrial arrhythmias. Heart rate variability ({HRV}) is a useful tool to assess sympathetic and parasympathetic influences on disease states. {HRV} can be improved following intervention and is thus a useful application in assessing autonomic dysfunction in patients with {AF}. Conclusion {ANS} plays a crucial role in the development, propagation and complexity of {AF}. Assessment of the autonomic involvement in the propagation of {AF} may help in explaining why certain patients with {AF} do not benefit from cardioversion or ablation.},

Identifying the underlying causative mechanisms of {AF} in individual patients is difficult and the efficacy of current therapies is suboptimal. Consequently, the incidence of {AF} is steadily rising and there is a pressing need for novel therapies. Research has revealed that defects in specific molecular pathways underlie {AF} pathogenesis, resulting in electrical conduction disorders that drive {AF}. The severity of this so-called electropathology correlates with the stage of {AF} disease progression and determines the response to {AF} treatment. Therefore, unravelling the molecular mechanisms underlying electropathology is expected to fuel the development of innovative personalized diagnostic tools and mechanism-based therapies. Moreover, the co-creation of {AF} studies with patients to implement novel diagnostic tools and therapies is a prerequisite for successful personalized {AF} management. Currently, various treatment modalities targeting {AF}-related electropathology, including lifestyle changes, pharmaceutical and nutraceutical therapy, substrate-based ablative therapy, and neuromodulation, are available to maintain sinus rhythm and might offer a novel holistic strategy to treat {AF}.},

Significant effort has been made over a number of years to define the underlying cellular, molecular and electrophysiological changes that predispose to the induction and maintenance of {AF} in patients. Progress has been limited by the realisation that {AF} is a complex arrhythmia that can be the end result of various different pathophysiological processes, with significant heterogeneity between individual patients (and between species). In this focused Review article, we aim to succinctly summarise for the non-specialist the current state of knowledge regarding the mechanisms of {AF}. We address all aspects of pathophysiology, including the basic electrophysiological and structural changes within the left atrium, the genetics of {AF} and the links to comorbidities and wider systemic and metabolic perturbations that may be upstream contributors to development of {AF}. Finally, we outline the translational implications for current and future rhythm control strategies in patients with {AF}.},

	abstract = {The past 3 decades have been characterized by an exponential growth in knowledge and advances in the clinical treatment of atrial fibrillation ({AF}). It is now known that {AF} genesis requires a vulnerable atrial substrate and that the formation and composition of this substrate may vary depending on comorbid conditions, genetics, sex, and other factors. Population-based studies have identified numerous factors that modify the atrial substrate and increase {AF} susceptibility. To date, genetic studies have reported 17 independent signals for {AF} at 14 genomic regions. Studies have established that advanced age, male sex, and European ancestry are prominent {AF} risk factors. Other modifiable risk factors include sedentary lifestyle, smoking, obesity, diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, and elevated blood pressure predispose to {AF}, and each factor has been shown to induce structural and electric remodeling of the atria. Both heart failure and myocardial infarction increase risk of {AF} and vice versa creating a feed-forward loop that increases mortality. Other cardiovascular outcomes attributed to {AF}, including stroke and thromboembolism, are well established, and epidemiology studies have championed therapeutics that mitigate these adverse outcomes. However, the role of anticoagulation for preventing dementia attributed to {AF} is less established. Our review is a comprehensive examination of the epidemiological data associating unmodifiable and modifiable risk factors for {AF} and of the pathophysiological evidence supporting the mechanistic link between each risk factor and {AF} genesis. Our review also critically examines the epidemiological data on clinical outcomes attributed to {AF} and summarizes current evidence linking each outcome with {AF}.},

	abstract = {Atrial fibrillation ({AF}) is a highly prevalent arrhythmia, with substantial associated morbidity and mortality. There have been significant management advances over the past 2 decades, but the burden of the disease continues to increase and there is certainly plenty of room for improvement in treatment options. A potential key to therapeutic innovation is a better understanding of underlying fundamental mechanisms. This article reviews recent advances in understanding the molecular basis for {AF}, with a particular emphasis on relating these new insights to opportunities for clinical translation. We first review the evidence relating basic electrophysiological mechanisms to the characteristics of clinical {AF}. We then discuss the molecular control of factors leading to some of the principal determinants, including abnormalities in impulse conduction (such as tissue fibrosis and other extra-cardiomyocyte alterations, connexin dysregulation and Na+-channel dysfunction), electrical refractoriness, and impulse generation. We then consider the molecular drivers of {AF} progression, including a range of Ca2+-dependent intracellular processes, {microRNA} changes, and inflammatory signaling. The concept of key interactome-related nodal points is then evaluated, dealing with systems like those associated with {CaMKII} (Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-{II}), {NLRP}3 ({NACHT}, {LRR}, and {PYD} domains-containing protein-3), and transcription-factors like {TBX}5 and {PitX}2c. We conclude with a critical discussion of therapeutic implications, knowledge gaps and future directions, dealing with such aspects as drug repurposing, biologicals, multispecific drugs, the targeting of cardiomyocyte inflammatory signaling and potential considerations in intervening at the level of interactomes and gene-regulation. The area of molecular intervention for {AF} management presents exciting new opportunities, along with substantial challenges.},

	doi = {10.1161/01.CIR.100.18.1879},
	abstract = {Background—Atrial fibrillation ({AF}) can be initiated by ectopic beats originating from the atrial or great venous tissues. This study investigated the anatomic characteristics and electrophysiological properties of pulmonary veins ({PVs}), as well as the possible mechanisms and response to drugs of ectopic foci, and assessed the effects of radiofrequency ({RF}) ablation on {AF} initiated by ectopic beats originating from {PVs}.Methods and Results—Seventy-nine patients with frequent episodes of paroxysmal {AF} and 10 control patients were included. Distal {PVs} showed the shortest effective refractory periods ({ERPs}), and right superior {PVs} showed a higher incidence of intra-{PV} conduction block than left superior {PVs}. Superior and left {PVs} had longer myocardial sleeves than inferior and right {PVs}, respectively. These electrophysiological characteristics were similar between {AF} and control patients. Propranolol, verapamil, and procainamide suppressed ectopic beats that originated from the {PVs}. Of 116 ectopic foci that initiated {AF}, 103 (88.8\%) originated from {PVs}. A mean of 7±3 {RF} applications completely eliminated 110 ectopic foci (94.8\%). During the 6±2-month follow-up period, 68 patients (86.1\%) were free of {AF} without any antiarrhythmic drugs. Follow-up transesophageal echocardiogram showed 42.4\% of ablated {PVs} had focal stenosis. One patient had mild exertional dyspnea after ablation, but it resolved 3 months later; 1 patient had onset of mild exertional dyspnea 5 months after ablation.Conclusions—Electrophysiological characteristics of {PVs} are different from those in the atria. Ectopic beats from {PVs} can initiate {AF}, and β-adrenergic receptor blocker, calcium channel blockers, and sodium channel blockers can suppress these ectopic beats. Careful mapping and elimination of these ectopic foci can cure paroxysmal {AF}.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Depolarizations similar to those from the sinus node have been documented from the pulmonary veins after isolation procedures. We assessed the hypothesis that sinus node-like tissue is present in the pulmonary veins of humans. Methods and Results: Pulmonary vein tissue was obtained from five autopsies (four individuals with a history of atrial fibrillation and one without a history of atrial arrhythmias) and five transplant heart donors. Autopsy veins were fixed in formaldehyde and processed for light microscopy to identify areas having possible conductive-like tissue. Areas requiring additional study were extracted from paraffin blocks and reprocessed for electron microscopy. Donor specimens were fixed in formaldehyde for histologic sections and glutaraldehyde for electron microscopy. Myocardial cells with pale cytoplasm were identified by light microscopy in 4 of the 5 autopsy subjects. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of P cells, transitional cells, and Purkinje cells in the pulmonary veins of these cases. Conclusion: Our report is the first to show the presence of P cells, transitional cells, and Purkinje cells in human pulmonary veins. Whether these cells are relevant in the genesis of atrial fibrillation requires further study. (J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol, Vol. 14, pp. 803-809, August 2003)},

	abstract = {The end point of current catheter-based ablation approaches for the treatment of atrial fibrillation ({AF}) is the elimination of all the possible triggers with the least amount of ablation necessary. Once all the triggers have been eliminated, the incremental value of any additional lesion sets remains to be proven. Pulmonary vein ({PV}) isolation is the cornerstone of catheter ablation approaches for eliminating {AF} triggers. However, up to 11\% of patients demonstrate reproducible sustained {AF} initiation from non-{PV} foci. In these patients, triggers can typically be elicited using standardized induction protocols, which include cardioversion of spontaneous and/or induced {AF} and infusion of high-dose isoproterenol. Non-{PV} triggers typically arise from discrete anatomical structures that include the mitral and tricuspid periannular regions, the crista terminalis and Eustachian ridge, the interatrial septum, the left atrial ({LA}) posterior wall, the left atrial appendage ({LAA}), and other thoracic veins such as the superior vena cava, the coronary sinus, and the ligament of Marshall. Localization of non-{PV} foci involves a detailed analysis of specific intra-atrial activation sequences using multipolar catheters in standard atrial locations coupled with information from the surface electrocardiogram P wave when possible. Multipolar catheters positioned along the coronary sinus and crista terminalis/superior vena cava region together with direct recordings from the right and left {PVs} allow a quick localization of non-{PV} foci. Elimination of non-{PV} triggers by means of focal ablation at the site of origin or isolation of arrhythmogenic structures (eg, {LA} posterior wall or superior vena cava) has been associated with improved arrhythmia-free survival.},

The importance of the autonomic nervous system in atrial arrhythmogenesis is also supported by circadian variation in the incidence of symptomatic {AF} in humans. Methods that reduce autonomic innervation or outflow have been shown to reduce the incidence of spontaneous or induced atrial arrhythmias, suggesting that neuromodulation may be helpful in controlling {AF}. In this review, we focus on the relationship between the autonomic nervous system and the pathophysiology of {AF} and the potential benefit and limitations of neuromodulation in the management of this arrhythmia. We conclude that autonomic nerve activity plays an important role in the initiation and maintenance of {AF}, and modulating autonomic nerve function may contribute to {AF} control. Potential therapeutic applications include ganglionated plexus ablation, renal sympathetic denervation, cervical vagal nerve stimulation, baroreflex stimulation, cutaneous stimulation, novel drug approaches, and biological therapies.

Analysis of the spatio-temporal cardiac excitation patterns in the frequency and phase domains has demonstrated the importance of rotors in research models of {AF}, however, the dynamics and role of rotors in human {AF} are still controversial. In this review, the current knowledge gained through research models and patient data that support the notion that rotors are key players in {AF} maintenance is summarized. We report and discuss discrepancies regarding rotor prevalence and stability in various studies, which can be attributed in part to methodological differences among mapping systems. Future research for validation and improvement of current clinical electrophysiology mapping technologies will be crucial for developing mechanistic-based selection and application of the best therapeutic strategy for individual {AF} patient, being it, pharmaceutical, ablative, or other approach.},

	doi = {10.1161/CIRCEP.109.910125},
	abstract = {Background—The electropathological substrate of persistent atrial fibrillation ({AF}) in humans is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to compare the spatiotemporal characteristics of the fibrillatory process in patients with normal sinus rhythm and long-standing persistent {AF}.Methods and Results—During cardiac surgery, epicardial mapping (244 electrodes) of the right atrium ({RA}), the left lateral wall ({LA}), and the posterior left atrium ({PV}) was performed in 24 patients with long-standing persistent {AF}. Twenty-five patients with normal sinus rhythm, in whom {AF} was induced by rapid pacing, served as a reference group. A mapping algorithm was developed that separated the complex fibrillation process into its individual elements (wave mapping). Parameters used to characterize the substrate of {AF} were (1) the total length of interwave conduction block, (2) the number of fibrillation waves, and (3) the ratio of block to collision of fibrillation waves (dissociation index). In 4403 maps of persistent {AF}, no evidence for the presence of stable foci or rotors was found. Instead, many narrow wavelets propagated simultaneously through the atrial wall. The lateral boundaries of these waves were formed by lines of interwave conduction block, predominantly oriented parallel to the atrial musculature. Lines of block were not fixed but continuously changed on a beat-to-beat basis. In patients with persistent {AF}, the total length of block in the {RA} was more than 6-fold higher than during acute {AF} (median, 21.1 versus 3.4 mm/cm2; P{\textless}0.0001). The highest degree of interwave conduction block was found in the {PV} area (33.0 mm/cm2). The number of fibrillation waves during persistent {AF} was 4.5/cm2 compared with 2.3 during acute {AF}, and the dissociation index was 7.3 versus 1.5 (P{\textless}0.0001). The interindividual variation of these parameters among patients was high.Conclusions—Electric dissociation of neighboring atrial muscle bundles is a key element in the development of the substrate of human {AF}. The degree of the pathological changes can be measured on an individual basis by electrophysiological parameters in the spatial domain.},

These artifacts may be nonspecific or may resemble serious arrhythmia. Clinical signs, along with monitored waveforms from other simultaneously monitored parameters, may provide the clues to differentiate artifacts from true changes on the electrocardiogram. Simple measures, such as proper attention to basic principles of electrocardiographic measurement, can eliminate some artifacts. However, in persistent cases, expert help may be required to identify the precise source and minimize interference on the electrocardiogram. Technological advancements in processing the electrocardiographic signal may be useful to detect and eliminate artifacts.

	abstract = {The atrial structure/substrate of patients with atrial fibrillation ({AF}) and clinically similar characteristics can present very differently, and also the ‘phenotype’ (i.e. paroxysmal, persistent, and long standing persistent) of the arrhythmia cannot comprehensively explain these differences. It was unclear why some patients stay in paroxysmal {AF} for decades, whereas other patients with the same characteristics progress to persistent {AF} within a few months. In this review, evidence is described that {AF} patients without apparent structural heart disease have a chronic fibrotic bi-atrial substrate. There is also evidence from intraoperatively obtained specimen analysis, post-mortem autopsy findings, electroanatomic mapping studies, and delayed enhancement-{MRI} investigations that a higher mean value of fibrosis is detected in patients with persistent vs. paroxysmal {AF} but that the variability in the extend of fibrosis is always very high with part of paroxysmal {AF} patients having massive fibrosis and part of persistent {AF} patients showing mild fibrosis. In addition, patients undergoing ablation very early after the first {AF} episodes show already significant fibrosis. These data do not support a causal relationship that {AF} (significantly) produces fibrosis in the sense of ‘{AF} begets {AF}' instead of being a consequence of the fibrotic process. In patients with mitral stenosis, evidence for reverse atrial remodelling after commissurotomy was reported, however, in patients with ‘lone' {AF}, the atrial substrate progressed after successful {AF} elimination indicating towards the independent/progressive disease process of an underlying structural atrial disease called fibrotic atrial cardiomyopathy. Other ‘conventional wisdoms' also need to be re-considered including the aetiological role of age and arterial hypertension for human structural atrial remodelling.},

Two to 3 Weeks after implantation, the animals were connected to a fibrillation pacemaker which artificially maintained {AF}. Whereas during control episodes of {AF} were short lasting (6±3 seconds), artificial maintenance of {AF} resulted in a progressive increase in the duration of {AF} to become sustained ({\textgreater}24 hours) after 7.1±4.8 days (10 of 11 goats). During the first 24 hours of {AF} the median fibrillation interval shortened from 145±18 to 108±8 ms and the inducibility of {AF} by a single premature stimulus increased from 24\% to 76\%. The atrial effective refractory period ({AERP}) shortened from 146±19 to 95±20 ms (−35\%) (S1S1, 400 ms). At high pacing rates the shortening was less (−12\%), pointing to a reversion of the normal adaptation of the {AERP} to heart rate. In 5 goats, after 2 to 4 weeks of {AF}, sinus rhythm was restored and all electrophysiological changes were found to be reversible within 1 week.Conclusions Artificial maintenance of {AF} leads to a marked shortening of {AERP}, a reversion of its physiological rate adaptation, and an increase in rate, inducibility and stability of {AF}. All these changes were completely reversible within 1 week of sinus rhythm.},

To this end, a key requirement is to develop models that can generalize to unseen distributions. Domain generalization ({DG}), i.e., out-of-distribution generalization, has attracted increasing interests in recent years. Domain generalization deals with a challenging setting where one or several different but related domain(s) are given, and the goal is to learn a model that can generalize to an unseen test domain. Great progress has been made in the area of domain generalization for years. This paper presents the first review of recent advances in this area. First, we provide a formal definition of domain generalization and discuss several related fields. We then thoroughly review the theories related to domain generalization and carefully analyze the theory behind generalization. We categorize recent algorithms into three classes: data manipulation, representation learning, and learning strategy, and present several popular algorithms in detail for each category. Third, we introduce the commonly used datasets, applications, and our open-sourced codebase for fair evaluation. Finally, we summarize existing literature and present some potential research topics for the future.},

	abstract = {Traditional machine learning paradigms are based on the assumption that both training and test data follow the same statistical pattern, which is mathematically referred to as Independent and Identically Distributed (\$i.i.d.\$). However, in real-world applications, this \$i.i.d.\$ assumption often fails to hold due to unforeseen distributional shifts, leading to considerable degradation in model performance upon deployment. This observed discrepancy indicates the significance of investigating the Out-of-Distribution ({OOD}) generalization problem. {OOD} generalization is an emerging topic of machine learning research that focuses on complex scenarios wherein the distributions of the test data differ from those of the training data. This paper represents the first comprehensive, systematic review of {OOD} generalization, encompassing a spectrum of aspects from problem definition, methodological development, and evaluation procedures, to the implications and future directions of the field. Our discussion begins with a precise, formal characterization of the {OOD} generalization problem. Following that, we categorize existing methodologies into three segments: unsupervised representation learning, supervised model learning, and optimization, according to their positions within the overarching learning process. We provide an in-depth discussion on representative methodologies for each category, further elucidating the theoretical links between them. Subsequently, we outline the prevailing benchmark datasets employed in {OOD} generalization studies. To conclude, we overview the existing body of work in this domain and suggest potential avenues for future research on {OOD} generalization.

	abstract = {Generalization to out-of-distribution ({OOD}) data is a capability natural to humans yet challenging for machines to reproduce. This is because most learning algorithms strongly rely on the i.i.d. assumption on source/target data, which is often violated in practice due to domain shift. Domain generalization ({DG}) aims to achieve {OOD} generalization by using only source data for model learning. Over the last ten years, research in {DG} has made great progress, leading to a broad spectrum of methodologies, e.g., those based on domain alignment, meta-learning, data augmentation, or ensemble learning, to name a few; {DG} has also been studied in various application areas including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, medical imaging, and reinforcement learning. In this paper, for the first time a comprehensive literature review in {DG} is provided to summarize the developments over the past decade. Specifically, we first cover the background by formally defining {DG} and relating it to other relevant fields like domain adaptation and transfer learning. Then, we conduct a thorough review into existing methods and theories. Finally, we conclude this survey with insights and discussions on future research directions.},

	shorttitle = {Failure to Achieve Domain Invariance With Domain Generalization Algorithms},
	abstract = {One prominent issue in the application of deep learning is the failure to generalize to data that lies on a different distribution to the training data. While many methods have been proposed to address this, prior work has shown that when operating under the same conditions most algorithms perform almost equally. As such, more work needs to be done to validate past and future methods before they are put into important scenarios like medical imaging. Our work analyses eight domain generalization algorithms across four important medical imaging classification datasets along with three standard natural image classification problems to discover the differences in how these methods operate in these different contexts. We assess these algorithms in terms of generalization capability, domain invariance, and representational sensitivity. Through this, we show that despite the differences between domain and content variations between natural and medical imaging there is little deviation in the operation of each method between natural images and medical images. Additionally, we show that all tested algorithms retain significant amounts of domain-specific information in their feature representations despite explicit training to remove it. Thus, revealing the failure point of all these methods is a lack of class-discriminative features extracted from out-of-distribution data. While these results show that methods that work well on natural imaging work similarly in medical imaging, no method outperforms baseline methods, highlighting the continuing gap of achieving adequate domain generalization. Similarly, the results also question the efficacy of optimizing for domain invariant representations as a method for generalizing to unseen domains.},

We modified an {SE}-{ResNet} to perform multi-task classification of both dataset and disease. We used a gradient reversal layer as part of an adversarial feature learning scheme to learn domain-invariant and discriminative representations. Results: We trained our domain-invariant model on 5 datasets, keeping one data set (Ningbo) for local validation. We also trained a baseline {SE}-{ResNet} using the same training data. In validation on the held-out data set, the domain-invariant model had a higher Challenge metric than the baseline model. Our entry was not officially ranked in the Challenge, as we did not have a successful entry during the unofficial phase of the Challenge. Conclusion: The domain-invariant model performed better than the baseline model in local held-out datasets, suggesting that this method may help improve generalisation performance.},

	abstract = {Deep Learning systems have achieved great success in the past few years, even surpassing human intelligence in several cases. As of late, they have also established themselves in the biomedical and healthcare domains, where they have shown a lot of promise, but have not yet achieved widespread adoption. This is in part due to the fact that most methods fail to maintain their performance when they are called to make decisions on data that originate from a different distribution than the one they were trained on, namely Out-Of-Distribution ({OOD}) data. For example, in the case of biosignal classification, models often fail to generalize well on datasets from different hospitals, due to the distribution discrepancy amongst different sources of data. Our goal is to demonstrate the Domain Generalization problem present between distinct hospital databases and propose a method that classifies abnormalities on 12-lead Electrocardiograms ({ECGs}), by leveraging information extracted across the architecture of a Deep Neural Network, and capturing the underlying structure of the signal. To this end, we adopt a {ResNet}-18 as the backbone model and extract features from several intermediate convolutional layers of the network. To evaluate our method, we adopt publicly available {ECG} datasets from four sources and handle them as separate domains. To simulate the distributional shift present in real-world settings, we train our model on a subset of the domains and leave-out the remaining ones. We then evaluate our model both on the data present at training time (intra-distribution) and the held-out data (out-of-distribution), achieving promising results and surpassing the baseline of a vanilla Residual Network in most of the cases.},

One of the main reasons lies in the fact that when models are presented with previously unseen, Out-of-Distribution samples, their performance deteriorates significantly. This is known as the Domain Generalization ({DG}) problem. Our objective in this work is to propose a benchmark for evaluating {DG} algorithms, in addition to introducing a novel architecture for tackling {DG} in biosignal classification. In this article, we describe the Domain Generalization problem for biosignals, focusing on electrocardiograms ({ECG}) and electroencephalograms ({EEG}) and propose and implement an open-source biosignal {DG} evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, we adapt state-of-the-art {DG} algorithms from computer vision to the problem of 1D biosignal classification and evaluate their effectiveness. Finally, we also introduce a novel neural network architecture that leverages multi-layer representations for improved model generalizability. By implementing the above {DG} setup we are able to experimentally demonstrate the presence of the {DG} problem in {ECG} and {EEG} datasets. In addition, our proposed model demonstrates improved effectiveness compared to the baseline algorithms, exceeding the state-of-the-art in both datasets. Recognizing the significance of the distribution shift present in biosignal datasets, the presented benchmark aims at urging further research into the field of biomedical {DG} by simplifying the evaluation process of proposed algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at developing an open-source framework for evaluating {ECG} and {EEG} {DG} algorithms.},

Although various models have been developed to tackle the heartbeat classification problem, their performance degrades on {ECG} signals recorded in varied testing conditions due to the distribution discrepancy among different sources of data. In this work, we have developed a multi-source domain generalization model to address the distribution discrepancy problem that occurred when the collection of the data is from multiple sources with various acquisition conditions. We have employed a combination of convolutional neural network ({CNN}) and long short term memory ({LSTM}) for feature extraction. Further, we exploit the adversarial domain generalization method to overcome probable heterogeneity between the train and test datasets. To increase generalization, we also utilized different augmentation techniques including random {ECG} pad and crop, adding low-frequency artifacts, and lead dropout.

	doi = {10.1109/TBCAS.2024.3418085},
	abstract = {Deep neural network ({DNN}) models have shown remarkable success in many real-world scenarios, such as object detection and classification. Unfortunately, these models are not yet widely adopted in health monitoring due to exceptionally high requirements for model robustness and deployment in highly resource-constrained devices. In particular, the acquisition of biosignals, such as electrocardiogram ({ECG}), is subject to large variations between training and deployment, necessitating domain generalization ({DG}) for robust classification quality across sensors and patients. The continuous monitoring of {ECG} also requires the execution of {DNN} models in convenient wearable devices, which is achieved by specialized {ECG} accelerators with small form factor and ultra-low power consumption. However, combining {DG} capabilities with {ECG} accelerators remains a challenge. This article provides a comprehensive overview of {ECG} accelerators and {DG} methods and discusses the implication of the combination of both domains, such that multi-domain {ECG} monitoring is enabled with emerging algorithm-hardware co-optimized systems. Within this context, an approach based on correction layers is proposed to deploy {DG} capabilities on the edge. Here, the {DNN} fine-tuning for unknown domains is limited to a single layer, while the remaining {DNN} model remains unmodified. Thus, computational complexity ({CC}) for {DG} is reduced with minimal memory overhead compared to conventional fine-tuning of the whole {DNN} model. The {DNN} model-dependent {CC} is reduced by more than 2.5 × compared to {DNN} fine-tuning at an average increase of F1 score by more than 20\% on the generalized target domain. In summary, this article provides a novel perspective on robust {DNN} classification on the edge for health monitoring applications.},

We begin by conducting a novel analysis of the data distributions on three popular {ECG}-based arrhythmia datasets: {PTB}-{XL}, Chapman, and Ribeiro. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to quantitatively explore and characterize these distributions in the area. We then perform a comprehensive set of experiments using different augmentations and parameters to evaluate the effectiveness of various {SSL} methods, namely {SimCRL}, {BYOL}, and {SwAV}, for {ECG} representation learning, where we observe the best performance achieved by {SwAV}. Furthermore, our analysis shows that {SSL} methods achieve highly competitive results to those achieved by supervised state-of-the-art methods. To further assess the performance of these methods on both In-Distribution ({ID}) and Out-of-Distribution ({OOD}) {ECG} data, we conduct cross-dataset training and testing experiments. Our comprehensive experiments show almost identical results when comparing {ID} and {OOD} schemes, indicating that {SSL} techniques can learn highly effective representations that generalize well across different {OOD} datasets. This finding can have major implications for {ECG}-based arrhythmia detection. Lastly, to further analyze our results, we perform detailed per-disease studies on the performance of the {SSL} methods on the three datasets.},

	abstract = {Objective: When training machine learning models, we often assume that the training data and evaluation data are sampled from the same distribution. However, this assumption is violated when the model is evaluated on another unseen but similar database, even if that database contains the same classes. This problem is caused by domain-shift and can be solved using two approaches: domain adaptation and domain generalization. Simply, domain adaptation methods can access data from unseen domains during training; whereas in domain generalization, the unseen data is not available during training. Hence, domain generalization concerns models that perform well on inaccessible, domain-shifted data. Method: Our proposed domain generalization method represents an unseen domain using a set of known basis domains, afterwhich we classify the unseen domain using classifier fusion. To demonstrate our system, we employ a collection of heart sound databases that contain normal and abnormal sounds (classes). Results: Our proposed classifier fusion method achieves accuracy gains of up to 16\% for four completely unseen domains. Conclusion: Recognizing the complexity induced by the inherent temporal nature of biosignal data, the two-stage method proposed in this study is able to effectively simplify the whole process of domain generalization while demonstrating good results on unseen domains and the adopted basis domains. Significance: To our best knowledge, this is the first study that investigates domain generalization for biosignal data. Our proposed learning strategy can be used to effectively learn domain-relevant features while being aware of the class differences in the data.},

	abstract = {Detection of arrhythmia of electrocardiogram ({ECG}) signals recorded within several sessions for each person is a challenging issue, which has not been properly investigated in the past. This arrhythmia detection is challenging since a classification model that is constructed and tested using {ECG} signals maintains generalization when dealing with unseen samples. This article has proposed a new interpretable meta structural learning algorithm for this challenging detection. Therefore, a compound loss function was suggested including the structural feature extraction fault and space label fault with {GUMBEL}-{SOFTMAX} distribution in the convolutional neural network ({CNN}) models. The collaboration between models was carried out to create learning to learn features in models by transferring the knowledge among them when confronted by unseen samples. One of the deficiencies of a meta-learning algorithm is the non-interpretability of its models. Therefore, to create an interpretability feature for {CNN} models, they are encoded as the evolutionary trees of the genetic programming ({GP}) algorithms in this article. These trees learn the process of extracting deep structural features in the course of the evolution in the {GP} algorithm. The experimental results suggested that the proposed detection model enjoys an accuracy of 98\% regarding the classification of 7 types of arrhythmia in the samples of the Chapman {ECG} dataset recorded from 10646 patients in different sessions. Finally, the comparisons demonstrated the competitive performance of the proposed model concerning the other models based on the big deep models.},

	abstract = {Automatic classification of cardiac abnormalities is becoming increasingly popular with the prevalence of {ECG} recordings. Many signal processing and machine learning algorithms have shown the potential to identify cardiac ab-normalities accurately. However, most of these methods heavily rely on a large amount of relatively homogeneous datasets. In real life, chances are that there is not enough data for a specific category, and regular deep learning may fail in this scenario. A straightforward intuition is to use the knowledge learned from previous data to solve the problem. This idea leads to learning-to-learn: extrapolating the knowledge accumulated from the old dataset and using it in a different but somewhat related dataset. In this way, we do not need to have considerable data to learn the new task because the underlying features of the old and new datasets resemble one another. In this paper, a novel machine learning method is introduced to solve the {ECG} arrhythmia detection problem with a limited amount of data. The proposed method combines the popular techniques of meta-learning and transfer learning. It is shown that our method achieves much higher accuracy in {ECG} arrhythmia classification with a few data and learns the new task faster than regular deep learning.},

	abstract = {Premature ventricular contraction ({PVC}) is a common and harmless cardiac arrhythmia that can be asymptomatic or cause palpitations and chest pain in rare instances. However, frequent {PVCs} can lead to more serious arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation. Several {PVC} detection models have been proposed to enable early diagnosis of arrhythmias; however, they lack reliability and generalizability due to the variability of electrocardiograms across different settings and noise levels. Such weaknesses are known to aggravate with new data. Therefore, we present a deep learning model with a novel attention mechanism that can detect {PVC} accurately, even on unseen electrocardiograms with various noise levels. Our method, called the Denoise and Contrast Attention Module ({DCAM}), is a two-step process that denoises signals with a convolutional neural network ({CNN}) in the frequency domain and attends to differences. It focuses on differences in the morphologies and intervals of the remaining beats, mimicking how trained clinicians identify {PVCs}. Using three different encoder types, we evaluated 1D U-Net with {DCAM} on six external test datasets. The results showed that {DCAM} significantly improved the F1-score of {PVC} detection performance on all six external datasets and enhanced the performance of balancing both the sensitivity and precision of the models, demonstrating its robustness and generalization ability regardless of the encoder type. This demonstrates the need for a trainable denoising process before applying the attention mechanism. Our {DCAM} could contribute to the development of a reliable algorithm for cardiac arrhythmia detection under real clinical electrocardiograms.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Extracting beat-by-beat information from electrocardiograms ({ECGs}) is crucial for various downstream diagnostic tasks that rely on {ECG}-based measurements. However, these measurements can be expensive and time-consuming to produce, especially for long-term recordings. Traditional {ECG} detection and delineation methods, relying on classical signal processing algorithms such as those based on wavelet transforms, produce high-quality delineations but struggle to generalise to diverse {ECG} patterns. Machine learning ({ML}) techniques based on deep learning algorithms have emerged as promising alternatives, capable of achieving similar performance without handcrafted features or thresholds. However, supervised {ML} techniques require large annotated datasets for training, and existing datasets for {ECG} detection/delineation are limited in size and the range of pathological conditions they represent.

Methods
This article addresses this challenge by introducing two key innovations. First, we develop a synthetic data generation scheme that probabilistically constructs unseen {ECG} traces from “pools” of fundamental segments extracted from existing databases. A set of rules guides the arrangement of these segments into coherent synthetic traces, while expert domain knowledge ensures the realism of the generated traces, increasing the input variability for training the model. Second, we propose two novel segmentation-based loss functions that encourage the accurate prediction of the number of independent {ECG} structures and promote tighter segmentation boundaries by focusing on a reduced number of samples.

Results
The proposed approach achieves remarkable performance, with a F1-score of 99.38\% and delineation errors of 2.19±17.73 ms and 4.45±18.32 ms for {ECG} segment onsets and offsets across the P, {QRS}, and T waves. These results, aggregated from three diverse freely available databases ({QT}, {LU}, and Zhejiang), surpass current state-of-the-art detection and delineation approaches.

Discussion
Notably, the model demonstrated exceptional performance despite variations in lead configurations, sampling frequencies, and represented pathophysiology mechanisms, underscoring its robust generalisation capabilities. Real-world examples, featuring clinical data with various pathologies, illustrate the potential of our approach to streamline {ECG} analysis across different medical settings, fostered by releasing the codes as open source.},

	abstract = {Detection of atrial fibrillation ({AF}), a type of cardiac arrhythmia, is difficult since many cases of {AF} are usually clinically silent and undiagnosed. In particular paroxysmal {AF} is a form of {AF} that occurs occasionally, and has a higher probability of being undetected. In this work, we present an attention based deep learning framework for detection of paroxysmal {AF} episodes from a sequence of windows. Time-frequency representation of 30 seconds recording windows, over a 10 minute data segment, are fed sequentially into a deep convolutional neural network for image-based feature extraction, which are then presented to a bidirectional recurrent neural network with an attention layer for {AF} detection. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for transient {AF} detection, we use a database of 24 hour Holter Electrocardiogram ({ECG}) recordings acquired from 2850 patients at the University of Virginia heart station. The algorithm achieves an {AUC} of 0.94 on the testing set, which exceeds the performance of baseline models. We also demonstrate the cross-domain generalizablity of the approach by adapting the learned model parameters from one recording modality ({ECG}) to another (photoplethysmogram) with improved {AF} detection performance. The proposed high accuracy, low false alarm algorithm for detecting paroxysmal {AF} has potential applications in long-term monitoring using wearable sensors.},

	doi = {10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3181727},
	abstract = {Detection of arrhythmia of electrocardiogram ({ECG}) signals recorded within several sessions for each person is a challenging issue, which has not been properly investigated in the past. This arrhythmia detection is challenging since a classification model that is constructed and tested using {ECG} signals maintains generalization when dealing with unseen samples. This article has proposed a new interpretable meta structural learning algorithm for this challenging detection. Therefore, a compound loss function was suggested including the structural feature extraction fault and space label fault with {GUMBEL}-{SOFTMAX} distribution in the convolutional neural network ({CNN}) models. The collaboration between models was carried out to create learning to learn features in models by transferring the knowledge among them when confronted by unseen samples. One of the deficiencies of a meta-learning algorithm is the non-interpretability of its models. Therefore, to create an interpretability feature for {CNN} models, they are encoded as the evolutionary trees of the genetic programming ({GP}) algorithms in this article. These trees learn the process of extracting deep structural features in the course of the evolution in the {GP} algorithm. The experimental results suggested that the proposed detection model enjoys an accuracy of 98\% regarding the classification of 7 types of arrhythmia in the samples of the Chapman {ECG} dataset recorded from 10646 patients in different sessions. Finally, the comparisons demonstrated the competitive performance of the proposed model concerning the other models based on the big deep models.},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been notable progress in deep learning-based electroencephalogram ({EEG}) analysis, particularly in sleep staging classification. However, the substantial variation in {EEG} signals across subjects poses a significant challenge, limiting model generalization. To tackle this issue, contrastive learning-based domain generalization ({DG}) has been proposed and has shown promising performance. In essence, {DG} aims to closely associate the features of the same class across multiple domains. Throughout this process, negative pairs from different domains are pushed further away from the anchor compared to negative pairs from the same domain, leading to the emergence of domain gaps. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to balance the effects of negative samples from different domains with negative samples in the same domain. It prevents the enlargement of domain gaps and enables the extraction of subject-invariant features. For the validity of our proposed method, we experimented on the {SleepEDF}-78 dataset. Experimental results demonstrated that our method outperformed the previous methods considered in our experiments.},

	abstract = {Electroencephalography ({EEG}) is shown to be a valuable data source for evaluating subjects' mental states. However, the interpretation of multi-modal {EEG} signals is challenging, as they suffer from poor signal-to-noise-ratio, are highly subject-dependent, and are bound to the equipment and experimental setup used, (i.e. domain). This leads to machine learning models often suffer from poor generalization ability, where they perform significantly worse on real-world data than on the exploited training data. Recent research heavily focuses on cross-subject and cross-session transfer learning frameworks to reduce domain calibration efforts for {EEG} signals. We argue that multi-source learning via learning domain-invariant representations from multiple data-sources is a viable alternative, as the available data from different {EEG} data-source domains (e.g., subjects, sessions, experimental setups) grow massively. We propose an adversarial inference approach to learn data-source invariant representations in this context, enabling multi-source learning for {EEG}-based brain- computer interfaces. We unify {EEG} recordings from different source domains (i.e., emotion recognition datasets {SEED}, {SEED}-{IV}, {DEAP}, {DREAMER}), and demonstrate the feasibility of our invariant representation learning approach in suppressing data- source-relevant information leakage by 35\% while still achieving stable {EEG}-based emotion classification performance.},

Electroencephalogram ({EEG}) has been used as an objective means of characterizing brain altered arousal and/or cognition states induced by anesthetics in real-time. Different general anesthetics affect cerebral electrical activities in different ways. However, the performance of conventional machine learning models on {EEG} data is unsatisfactory due to the low Signal to Noise Ratio ({SNR}) in the {EEG} signals, especially in the office-based anesthesia {EEG} setting. Deep learning models have been used widely in the field of Brain Computer Interface ({BCI}) to perform classification and pattern recognition tasks due to their capability of good generalization and handling noises. Compared to other {BCI} applications, where deep learning has demonstrated encouraging results, the deep learning approach for classifying different brain consciousness states under anesthesia has been much less investigated. In this paper, we propose a new framework based on meta-learning using deep neural networks, named Anes-{MetaNet}, to classify brain states under anesthetics. The Anes-{MetaNet} is composed of Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNN}) to extract power spectrum features, and a time consequence model based on Long Short-Term Memory ({LSTM}) networks to capture the temporal dependencies, and a meta-learning framework to handle large cross-subject variability. We use a multi-stage training paradigm to improve the performance, which is justified by visualizing the high-level feature mapping.

This problem is recognized as a major obstacle to {BCI}, and to overcome it, an approach based on domain generalization ({DG}) has recently emerged. The main purpose of this paper is to reconsider how the zero-calibration problem of {BCI} for a realistic situation can be overcome from the perspective of {DG} tasks. In terms of the realistic situation, we have focused on creating an {EEG} classification framework that can be applied directly in unseen sessions, using only multi-subject/-session data acquired previously. Therefore, in this paper, we tested four deep learning models and four {DG} algorithms through leave-one-session-out validation. Our experiment showed that deeper and larger models were effective in cross-session generalization performance. Furthermore, we found that none of the explicit {DG} algorithms outperformed empirical risk minimization. Finally, by comparing the results of fine-tuning using subject-specific data, we found that subject-specific data may deteriorate unseen session classification performance due to inter-session variability.},

However, most of the studies exploit the subjects within the same dataset, which might raise challenges especially when data from other subjects are scarce or inaccessible. To address this issue, we propose a meta-learning-based cross-dataset transfer learning for {MI} {EEG} classification. We first extract informative knowledge from the source dataset based on the meta-learning framework.

	abstract = {Generalizing the electroencephalogram ({EEG}) decoding methods to unseen subjects is an important research direction for realizing practical application of brain-computer interfaces ({BCIs}). Since distribution shifts across subjects, the performance of most current deep neural networks for decoding {EEG} signals degrades when dealing with unseen subjects. Domain generalization ({DG}) aims to tackle this issue by learning invariant representations across subjects. To this end, we propose a novel domain-generalized {EEG} classification framework, named {FDCL}, to generalize {EEG} decoding through category-relevant and -irrelevant Feature Decorrelation and Cross-view invariant feature Learning. Specifically, we first devise data augmented regularization through mixing the segments of same-category features from multiple subjects, which increases the diversity of {EEG} data by spanning the space of subjects. Furthermore, we introduce feature decorrelation regularization to learn the weights of the augmented {EEG} trials to remove the dependencies between their features, so that the true mapping relationship between relevant features and corresponding labels can be better established. To further distill subject-invariant {EEG} feature representations, cross-view consistency learning regularization is introduced to encourage consistent predictions of category-relevant features induced from different augmented {EEG} views. We seamlessly integrate three complementary regularizations into a unified {DG} framework to jointly improve the generalizability and robustness of the model on unseen subjects. Experimental results on motor imagery ({MI}) based {EEG} datasets validate that the proposed {FDCL} outperforms the available state-of-the-art methods.},

By simultaneously learning a shared feature extractor and numerous domain-specific classifiers, we train a single model to categorize emotions across various domains. Additionally, we present a feature fusion module that combines time-domain, frequency-domain, and wavelet-domain {EEG} characteristics.

Their prevalent adoption has led to their use in in-home patient monitoring and diagnosis to improve the quality of human life. The dependency on such systems requires the development of knowledge-intensive, high-performing models for superior healthcare outcomes. One of the most popular in-home telehealth systems is for monitoring cardiac events using Electrocardiogram ({ECG}) signals from the heart. {ECG} signals have a wide range of temporal, spatial, and frequency features which altogether account for clinical diagnosis. {ECG} recordings are usually obtained from 12 leads placed on the patient; however, the predominant body of research develops machine learning models using only a single lead or all 12 leads as 12 channels of a single model. We propose an approach to leverage knowledge from all 12 leads individually using double-stacked generalization which uses a meta-learner to develop an ensemble of single-channel and 12-channel deep learning models. Our proposed approach shows performance improvement of more than 5.2\% in Area under Curve ({AUC}) and 7.94\% in (Maximum F1 score) Fmax over individual lead models. Furthermore, our level 2 stacks 12-channel model with a level 1 meta-learner leveraging the features learned by the multi-channel and single-channel models leading to state-of-the-art Fmax and {AUC}.},

	abstract = {Automatic classification of cardiac abnormalities is becoming increasingly popular with the prevalence of {ECG} recordings. Many signal processing and machine learning algorithms have shown the potential to identify cardiac ab-normalities accurately. However, most of these methods heavily rely on a large amount of relatively homogeneous datasets. In real life, chances are that there is not enough data for a specific category, and regular deep learning may fail in this scenario. A straightforward intuition is to use the knowledge learned from previous data to solve the problem. This idea leads to learning-to-learn: extrapolating the knowledge accumulated from the old dataset and using it in a different but somewhat related dataset. In this way, we do not need to have considerable data to learn the new task because the underlying features of the old and new datasets resemble one another. In this paper, a novel machine learning method is introduced to solve the {ECG} arrhythmia detection problem with a limited amount of data. The proposed method combines the popular techniques of meta-learning and transfer learning. It is shown that our method achieves much higher accuracy in {ECG} arrhythmia classification with a few data and learns the new task faster than regular deep learning.},

	abstract = {Brain-computer interface ({BCI}) is challenging to use in practice due to the inter/intra-subject variability of electroencephalography ({EEG}). The {BCI} system, in general, necessitates a calibration technique to obtain subject/session-specific data in order to tune the model each time the system is utilized. This issue is acknowledged as a key hindrance to {BCI}, and a new strategy based on domain generalization has recently evolved to address it. In light of this, we've concentrated on developing an {EEG} classification framework that can be applied directly to data from unknown domains (i.e. subjects), using only data acquired from separate subjects previously. For this purpose, in this paper, we proposed a framework that employs the open-set recognition technique as an auxiliary task to learn subject-specific style features from the source dataset while helping the shared feature extractor with mapping the features of the unseen target dataset as a new unseen domain. Our aim is to impose cross-instance style in-variance in the same domain and reduce the open space risk on the potential unseen subject in order to improve the generalization ability of the shared feature extractor. Our experiments showed that using the domain information as an auxiliary network increases the generalization performance. Clinical relevance—This study suggests a strategy to improve the performance of the subject-independent {BCI} systems. Our framework can help to reduce the need for further calibration and can be utilized for a range of mental state monitoring tasks (e.g. neurofeedback, identification of epileptic seizures, and sleep disorders).},

	abstract = {Numerous automatic epileptic seizure detectors ({ESDs}) with excellent performances have been reported, but they generally experience performance degradation when tested with real-life clinical data. This has been blamed on the scarcity of high-quality training data, which leads to models that generalize poorly. There is consequently interest in methods to improve the quality and quantity of training data for {ESDs}. This study used a domain generalization approach to combine data from two different datasets for training an {ESD}, which was thereafter tested on a third dataset. A subspace of the {CHB}-{MIT} and {TUSZ} scalp {EEG} seizure datasets was extracted using transfer component analysis, based on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space approach. We then used the Azimuthal Equidistant Projection to transform 3D electrode coordinates into 2D space, followed by interpolation using the Clough-Tocher technique to generate 16x16 rasters. We thereafter generated feature vectors, each of which was a sequence of 17 ten-layer 16x16 raster arrays. The vectors were used to train a recurrent-convolutional neural network. The network had a 128-unit long short-term memory layer with inputs from 17 parallel networks each with three stacks of convolutional layers. Testing was based on a private 26-subject dataset, combined with randomly selected subsets of the {CHB}-{MIT} and {TUSZ} datasets. A combined sensitivity of 74.5\% was achieved, along with a false positive per hour rate of 0.84, and a latency of 2.32 s. Detection sensitivity on the private dataset was 72.5\%. These results compare favorably with results of large-scale validation studies in literature and confirm the viability of this approach to increasing the size of training datasets for {ESDs}.},

However, the substantial variation in {EEG} signals across subjects poses a significant challenge, limiting model generalization. To tackle this issue, contrastive learning-based domain generalization ({DG}) has been proposed and has shown promising performance. In essence, {DG} aims to closely associate the features of the same class across multiple domains. Throughout this process, negative pairs from different domains are pushed further away from the anchor compared to negative pairs from the same domain, leading to the emergence of domain gaps. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to balance the effects of negative samples from different domains with negative samples in the same domain. It prevents the enlargement of domain gaps and enables the extraction of subject-invariant features. For the validity of our proposed method, we experimented on the {SleepEDF}-78 dataset.

In this paper, domain generalization methods are introduced to reduce the influence of subject variability in {BCI} systems without requiring any information from unseen subjects. We first modify a deep adversarial network for domain generalization and then propose a novel adversarial domain generalization framework, {DResNet}, in which domain information is utilized to learn two components of weights: unbiased weights that are common across subjects and biased weights that are subject-specific. Experimental results on two public {EEG} datasets indicate that our proposed methods can achieve a performance comparable to and more stable than that of the state-of-the-art domain adaptation method. In contrast to existing domain adaptation methods, our proposed domain generalization approach does not require any data from test subjects and can simultaneously generalize well to multiple test subjects.},

In this work, we approach {SSDG} from the perspective of input space augmentation to generate diverse and realistic images. Specifically, we moderate the strength of image augmentations through random composition of augmentations using a linear decay function. We also introduce a self-interpolation technique to improve training stability and sample diversity by facilitating a smoother transition between augmented and non-augmented images. Experiments on multi-site fundus image segmentation datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms prior {SSDG} methods without any additional computation cost. In addition, the proposed self-interpolation technique can also be integrated seamlessly with existing methods to improve {SSDG} performance.},

	abstract = {Deep learning models usually suffer from the domain shift issue, where models trained on one source domain do not generalize well to other unseen domains. In this work, we investigate the single-source domain generalization problem: training a deep network that is robust to unseen domains, under the condition that training data are only available from one source domain, which is common in medical imaging applications. We tackle this problem in the context of cross-domain medical image segmentation. In this scenario, domain shifts are mainly caused by different acquisition processes. We propose a simple causality-inspired data augmentation approach to expose a segmentation model to synthesized domain-shifted training examples. Specifically, 1) to make the deep model robust to discrepancies in image intensities and textures, we employ a family of randomly-weighted shallow networks. They augment training images using diverse appearance transformations. 2) Further we show that spurious correlations among objects in an image are detrimental to domain robustness. These correlations might be taken by the network as domain-specific clues for making predictions, and they may break on unseen domains. We remove these spurious correlations via causal intervention. This is achieved by resampling the appearances of potentially correlated objects independently. The proposed approach is validated on three cross-domain segmentation scenarios: cross-modality ({CT}-{MRI}) abdominal image segmentation, cross-sequence ({bSSFP}-{LGE}) cardiac {MRI} segmentation, and cross-site prostate {MRI} segmentation. The proposed approach yields consistent performance gains compared with competitive methods when tested on unseen domains.},

Model failures due to poor generalizability are quite common in practice and may prove quite perilous in mission-critical applications, e.g., diagnostic imaging where real-world data often exhibits pronounced variability. Such limitations have led to increased interest in domain generalization ({DG}) approaches that improve the ability of models learned from a single or multiple source domains to generalize to out-of-distribution ({OOD}) test domains. In this work, we propose {BoosterNet}, a lean add-on network that can be simply appended to any arbitrary core network to improve its generalization capability without requiring any changes in its architecture or training procedure. Specifically, using a novel measure of feature culpability, {BoosterNet} is trained episodically on the most and least culpable data features extracted from critical units in the core network based on their contribution towards class-specific prediction errors, which have shown to improve generalization. At inference time, corresponding test image features are extracted from the closest class-specific units, determined by smart gating via a Siamese network, and fed to {BoosterNet} for improved generalization. We evaluate the performance of {BoosterNet} within two very different classification problems, digits and skin lesions, and demonstrate a marked improvement in model generalization to {OOD} test domains compared to {SOTA}.},

Our {AADG} framework can effectively sample data augmentation policies that generate novel domains and diversify the training set from an appropriate search space. Specifically, we introduce a novel proxy task maximizing the diversity among multiple augmented novel domains as measured by the Sinkhorn distance in a unit sphere space, making automated augmentation tractable.

Quantitative and qualitative experiments on 11 publicly-accessible fundus image datasets (four for retinal vessel segmentation, four for optic disc and cup ({OD}/{OC}) segmentation and three for retinal lesion segmentation) are comprehensively performed. Two {OCTA} datasets for retinal vasculature segmentation are further involved to validate cross-modality generalization. Our proposed {AADG} exhibits state-of-the-art generalization performance and outperforms existing approaches by considerable margins on retinal vessel, {OD}/{OC} and lesion segmentation tasks.

	doi = {10.1109/TMI.2020.2973595},
	abstract = {Recent advances in deep learning for medical image segmentation demonstrate expert-level accuracy. However, application of these models in clinically realistic environments can result in poor generalization and decreased accuracy, mainly due to the domain shift across different hospitals, scanner vendors, imaging protocols, and patient populations etc. Common transfer learning and domain adaptation techniques are proposed to address this bottleneck. However, these solutions require data (and annotations) from the target domain to retrain the model, and is therefore restrictive in practice for widespread model deployment. Ideally, we wish to have a trained (locked) model that can work uniformly well across unseen domains without further training. In this paper, we propose a deep stacked transformation approach for domain generalization. Specifically, a series of n stacked transformations are applied to each image during network training. The underlying assumption is that the “expected” domain shift for a specific medical imaging modality could be simulated by applying extensive data augmentation on a single source domain, and consequently, a deep model trained on the augmented “big” data ({BigAug}) could generalize well on unseen domains. We exploit four surprisingly effective, but previously understudied, image-based characteristics for data augmentation to overcome the domain generalization problem. We train and evaluate the {BigAug} model (with n=9 transformations) on three different 3D segmentation tasks (prostate gland, left atrial, left ventricle) covering two medical imaging modalities ({MRI} and ultrasound) involving eight publicly available challenge datasets. The results show that when training on relatively small dataset (n = 10 32 volumes, depending on the size of the available datasets) from a single source domain: (i) {BigAug} models degrade an average of 11\%(Dice score change) from source to unseen domain, substantially better than conventional augmentation (degrading 39\%) and {CycleGAN}-based domain adaptation method (degrading 25\%), (ii) {BigAug} is better than “shallower” stacked transforms (i.e. those with fewer transforms) on unseen domains and demonstrates modest improvement to conventional augmentation on the source domain, (iii) after training with {BigAug} on one source domain, performance on an unseen domain is similar to training a model from scratch on that domain when using the same number of training samples. When training on large datasets (n = 465 volumes) with {BigAug}, (iv) application to unseen domains reaches the performance of state-of-the-art fully supervised models that are trained and tested on their source domains. These findings establish a strong benchmark for the study of domain generalization in medical imaging, and can be generalized to the design of highly robust deep segmentation models for clinical deployment.},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been significant progress in medical image segmentation utilizing deep learning techniques. However, these achievements largely rely on the supposition that the source and target domain data are identically distributed, and the direct application of related methods without addressing the distribution shift results in dramatic degradation in realistic clinical environments. Current approaches concerning the distribution shift either require the target domain data in advance for adaptation, or focus only on the distribution shift across domains while ignoring the intra-domain data variation. This paper proposes a domain-aware dual attention network for the generalized medical image segmentation task on unseen target domains. To alleviate the severe distribution shift between the source and target domains, an Extrinsic Attention ({EA}) module is designed to learn image features with knowledge originating from multi-source domains. Moreover, an Intrinsic Attention ({IA}) module is also proposed to handle the intra-domain variation by individually modeling the pixel-region relations derived from an image. The {EA} and {IA} modules complement each other well in terms of modeling the extrinsic and intrinsic domain relationships, respectively. To validate the model effectiveness, comprehensive experiments are conducted on various benchmark datasets, including the prostate segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) scans and the optic cup/disc segmentation in fundus images. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model effectively generalizes to unseen domains and exceeds the existing advanced approaches.},

	doi = {10.1109/WACV57701.2024.00751},
	abstract = {Diabetic retinopathy ({DR}) is caused by long-standing diabetes and is among the fifth leading cause for visual impairment. The prospects of early diagnosis and treatment could be helpful in curing the disease, however, the detection procedure is rather challenging and mostly tedious. Therefore, automated diabetic retinopathy classification using deep learning techniques has gained interest in the medical imaging community. Akin to several other real-world applications of deep learning, the typical assumption of i.i.d data is also violated in {DR} classification that relies on deep learning. Therefore, developing {DR} classification methods robust to unseen distributions is of great value. In this paper, we study the problem of generalizing a model to unseen distributions or domains (a.k.a domain generalization) in {DR} classification. To this end, we propose a simple and effective domain generalization ({DG}) approach that achieves self-distillation in vision transformers ({ViT}) via a novel prediction softening mechanism. This prediction softening is an adaptive convex combination of one-hot labels with the model’s own knowledge. We perform extensive experiments on challenging open-source {DR} classification datasets under both multi-source and more challenging single-source {DG} settings with three different {ViT} backbones to establish the efficacy and applicability of our approach against competing methods. For the first time, we report the performance of several state-of-the-art domain generalization ({DG}) methods on open-source {DR} classification datasets after conducting thorough experiments. Finally, our method is also capable of delivering improved calibration performance than other methods, showing its suitability for safety-critical applications, including health-care. We hope that our contributions would instigate more {DG} research across the medical imaging community. Code is available at github.com/Chumsy0725/{SPSD}-{ViT}.},

	doi = {10.1109/JBHI.2024.3397611},
	abstract = {A major challenge in applying deep learning to medical imaging is the paucity of annotated data. This study explores the use of synthetic images for data augmentation to address the challenge of limited annotated data in colonoscopy lesion classification. We demonstrate that synthetic colonoscopy images generated by Generative Adversarial Network ({GAN}) inversion can be used as training data to improve polyp classification performance by deep learning models. We invert pairs of images with the same label to a semantically rich and disentangled latent space and manipulate latent representations to produce new synthetic images. These synthetic images maintain the same label as the input pairs. We perform image modality translation (style transfer) between white light and narrow-band imaging ({NBI}). We also generate realistic synthetic lesion images by interpolating between original training images to increase the variety of lesion shapes in the training dataset. Our experiments show that {GAN} inversion can produce multiple colonoscopy data augmentations that improve the downstream polyp classification performance by 2.7\% in F1-score and 4.9\% in sensitivity over other methods, including state-of-the-art data augmentation. Testing on unseen out-of-domain data also showcased an improvement of 2.9\% in F1-score and 2.7\% in sensitivity. This approach outperforms other colonoscopy data augmentation techniques and does not require re-training multiple generative models. It also effectively uses information from diverse public datasets, even those not specifically designed for the targeted downstream task, resulting in strong domain generalizability.

	abstract = {The domain shift between training and testing data presents a significant challenge for training generalizable deep learning models. As a consequence, the performance of models trained with the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) assumption deteriorates when deployed in the real world. This problem is exacerbated in the medical imaging context due to variations in data acquisition across clinical centers, medical apparatus, and patients. Domain generalization ({DG}) aims to address this problem by learning a model that generalizes well to any unseen target domain. Many domain generalization techniques were unsuccessful in learning domain-invariant representations due to the large domain shift. Furthermore, multiple tasks in medical imaging are not yet extensively studied in existing literature when it comes to {DG} point of view. In this paper, we introduce a {DG} method that re-establishes the model objective function as a maximization of mutual information with a large pretrained model to the medical imaging field. We re-visit the problem of {DG} in Diabetic Retinopathy ({DR}) classification to establish a clear benchmark with a correct model selection strategy and to achieve robust domain-invariant representation for an improved generalization. Moreover, we conduct extensive experiments on public datasets to show that our proposed method consistently outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by a margin of 5.25\% in average accuracy and a lower standard deviation.

The method learns a domain-agnostic feature representation to improve generalization of models to the unseen test distribution. The method can be used for any imaging task, as it does not depend on the underlying model architecture. We validate the approach through a computed tomography ({CT}) vertebrae segmentation task across healthy and pathological cases on three datasets. Next, we employ few-shot learning, i.e. training the generalized model using very few examples from the unseen domain, to quickly adapt the model to new unseen data distribution. Our results suggest that the method could help generalize models across different medical centers, image acquisition protocols, anatomies, different regions in a given scan, healthy and diseased populations across varied imaging modalities.},

	abstract = {Atrial fibrillation ({AF}) is a type of cardiac arrhythmia affecting millions of people every year. This disease increases the likelihood of strokes, heart failure, and even death. While dedicated medical-grade electrocardiogram ({ECG}) devices can enable gold-standard analysis, these devices are expensive and require clinical settings. Recent advances in the capabilities of general-purpose smartphones and wearable technology equipped with photoplethysmography ({PPG}) sensors increase diagnostic accessibility for most populations. This work aims to develop a single model that can generalize {AF} classification across the modalities of {ECG} and {PPG} with a unified knowledge representation. This is enabled by approximating the transformation of signals obtained from low-cost wearable {PPG} sensors in terms of Pulse Rate Variability ({PRV}) to temporal Heart Rate Variability ({HRV}) features extracted from medical-grade {ECG}. This paper proposes a one-dimensional deep convolutional neural network that uses {HRV}-derived features for classifying 30-s heart rhythms as normal sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation from both {ECG} and {PPG}-based sensors. The model is trained with three {MIT}-{BIH} {ECG} databases and is assessed on a dataset of unseen {PPG} signals acquired from wrist-worn wearable devices through transfer learning. The model achieved the aggregate binary classification performance measures of accuracy: 95.50\%, sensitivity: 94.50\%, and specificity: 96.00\% across a five-fold cross-validation strategy on the {ECG} datasets. It also achieved 95.10\% accuracy, 94.60\% sensitivity, 95.20\% specificity on an unseen {PPG} dataset. The results show considerable promise towards seamless adaptation of gold-standard {ECG} trained models for non-ambulatory {AF} detection with consumer wearable devices through {HRV}-based knowledge transfer.},

Angestrebt wird die Erkennung spezieller kardiologischer und nichtkardiologischer Krankheitsbilder sowie die Vorhersage zukünftiger Krankheitszustände, z. B. die zukünftige Entwicklung einer linksventrikulären Dysfunktion oder das zukünftige Auftreten von Vorhofflimmern. Möglich wird dies, indem {KI} mittels {DL} in riesigen {EKG}-Datensätzen subklinische Muster findet und für die Algorithmen-Entwicklung nutzt. Die {KI}-unterstützte {EKG}-Analyse wird somit zu einem Screening-Instrument und geht weit darüber hinaus, nur besser als ein Kardiologe zu sein. Die erzielten Fortschritte sind bemerkenswert und sorgen in Fachwelt und Öffentlichkeit für Aufmerksamkeit und Euphorie. Bei den meisten Studien handelt es sich allerdings um Proof-of-Concept-Studien. Häufig werden private (institutionseigene) Daten verwendet, deren Qualität unklar ist. Bislang ist nur selten eine klinische Validierung der entwickelten Algorithmen in anderen Kollektiven und Szenarien erfolgt. Besonders problematisch ist, dass der Weg, wie {KI} eine Lösung findet, bislang meistens verborgen bleibt (Blackbox-Charakter). Damit steckt die {KI}-basierte Elektrokardiographie noch in den Kinderschuhen. Unbestritten ist aber schon absehbar, dass das {EKG} als einfach anzuwendendes und beliebig oft wiederholbares diagnostisches Verfahren auch in Zukunft nicht nur weiterhin unverzichtbar sein wird, sondern durch {KI} an klinischer Bedeutung gewinnen wird.},

	abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases are the global leading cause of death. Automated electrocardiogram ({ECG}) analysis can support clinicians to identify abnormal excitation of the heart and prevent premature cardiovascular death. An explainable classification is particularly important for support systems. Our contribution to the {PhysioNet}/{CinC} Challenge 2021 (team name: {ibmtPeakyFinders}) therefore pursues an approach that is based on interpretable features to be as explainable as possible. To meet the challenge goal of developing an algorithm that works for both 12-lead and reduced lead {ECGs}, we processed each lead separately. We focused on signal processing techniques based on template delineation that yield the template’s fiducial points to take the {ECG} waveform morphology into account. In addition to beat intervals and amplitudes obtained from the template, various heart rate variability and {QT} interval variability features were extracted and supplemented by signal quality indices. Our classification approach utilized a decision tree ensemble in a one-vs-rest approach. The model parameters were determined using an extensive grid search. Our approach achieved challenge scores of 0.47, 0.47, 0.34, 0.40, and 0.41 on hidden 12-, 6-, 3-, 4-, and 2-lead test sets, respectively, which corresponds to the ranks 12, 10, 23, 18, and 16 out of 39 teams.},

The ﬁnal model consists of three submodels forming a majority voting classiﬁcation ensemble. The proposed method classiﬁes {ECGs} with a variable number of leads, e.g., 12-lead, 6-lead, 4-lead, 3-lead, and 2-lead. The algorithm was validated and tested on the external hidden datasets ({CPSC}, G12EC, undisclosed set, {UMich}), achieving a challenge score 0.58 for all tested lead conﬁgurations.

	abstract = {Objective. Automatic electrocardiogram ({ECG}) interpretation based on deep learning methods is attracting increasing attention. In this study, we propose a novel method to accurately classify multi-lead {ECGs} using deep residual neural networks. Approach. {ECG} recordings from seven different open databases were provided by {PhysioNet}/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2021. All the {ECGs} were pre-processed to obtain the same sampling rate. The label inconsistency among the databases was corrected by adding or removing specific labels. A label mask was created to filter out potentially incorrectly labelled data. Five models based on deep residual convolutional neural networks were optimized using an asymmetric loss function to classify multi-lead {ECGs}. Main results. The proposed method achieved an official challenge score of 0.54, 0.52, 0.50, 0.51, and 0.50 on twelve-lead, six-lead, four-lead, three-lead, and two-lead {ECG} test sets, respectively.

The proposed method can correct the differential labeling tendency of databases from different sources and exhibits good generalization for classifying multi-lead {ECGs} in the hidden test set.

	abstract = {Deep Learning has made significant strides in classifying Cardiovascular diseases using 12-lead Electrocardiogram ({ECG}) signals. However, their lack of interpretability poses a significant challenge, thereby limiting their acceptance within the scientific community. This can be attributed to the large number of parameters and the susceptibility of deep neural networks to capturing irrelevant features. To address the challenge, it is crucial to provide explanations for the model's output. This is accomplished through {eXplainable} Artificial Intelligence ({XAI}), which aims to unravel the “black-box” nature of deep learning models. In this paper, we propose X-{ECGNet}, an {eXplainable} multi-branch Convolutional Neural Network designed for multi-label classification of 12-lead {ECG} signals. Our approach enables the extraction of features from individual leads in the 12-lead {ECG} independently, which are then combined to maximize the acquisition of information. We leverage this architectural design to generate explanations for each {ECG} lead using the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-{CAM}) technique. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our model using the {PTB}-{XL} dataset, achieving an {AUC} score of 0.936, thus enhancing both the model's performance and interpretability.},

We proposed a squeeze and excite {ResNet} to automatically learn deep features from 12-lead {ECGs}, in order to identify 24 cardiac conditions. The deep features were augmented with age and gender features in the final fully connected layers. Output thresholds for each class were set using a constrained grid search. To determine why the model made incorrect predictions, two expert clinicians independently interpreted a random set of 100 misclassified {ECGs} concerning left axis deviation. Results. Using the bespoke weighted accuracy metric, we achieved a 5-fold cross-validation score of 0.684, and sensitivity and specificity of 0.758 and 0.969, respectively. We scored 0.520 on the full test data, and ranked 2nd out of 41 in the official challenge rankings. On a random set of misclassified {ECGs}, agreement between two clinicians and training labels was poor (clinician 1: κ = −0.057, clinician 2: κ = −0.159). In contrast, agreement between the clinicians was very high (κ = 0.92). Discussion. The proposed prediction model performed well on the validation and hidden test data in comparison to models trained on the same data. We also discovered considerable inconsistency in training labels, which is likely to hinder development of more accurate models.},

Diagnosis of arrhythmias using electrocardiograms ({ECG}) is widely used because they are a fast, inexpensive, and non-invasive tool. However, the randomness of arrhythmic events and the susceptibility of {ECGs} to noise leads to misdiagnosis of arrhythmias. In addition, manually diagnosing cardiac arrhythmias using {ECG} data is time-intensive and error-prone. With better training, deep learning ({DL}) could be a better alternative for fast and automatic classification. The present study introduces a novel deep learning architecture, specifically a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-{CNN}), for the classification of cardiac arrhythmias. The model was trained and validated with real and noise-attenuated {ECG} signals from the {MIT}-{BIH} dataset. The main aim is to address the limitations of traditional electrocardiograms ({ECG}) in the diagnosis of arrhythmias, which can be affected by noise and randomness of events, leading to misdiagnosis and errors. To evaluate the model performance, the confusion matrix is used to calculate the model accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score, average and {AUC}-{ROC}. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed model achieved outstanding performance, with 1.00 and 0.99 accuracies in the training and testing datasets, respectively, and can be a fast and automatic alternative for the diagnosis of arrhythmias.},

This paper presents a generic and robust system for R-peak detection in Holter {ECG} signals. While many proposed algorithms have successfully addressed the problem of {ECG} R-peak detection, there is still a notable gap in the performance of these detectors on such low-quality {ECG} records.

 In this study, a novel implementation of the 1D Convolutional Neural Network ({CNN}) is used integrated with a verification model to reduce the number of false alarms. This {CNN} architecture consists of an encoder block and a corresponding decoder block followed by a sample-wise classification layer to construct the 1D segmentation map of R-peaks from the input {ECG} signal. Once the proposed model has been trained, it can solely be used to detect R-peaks possibly in a single channel {ECG} data stream quickly and accurately, or alternatively, such a solution can be conveniently employed for real-time monitoring on a lightweight portable device.

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed systematic approach achieves 99.30\% F1-score, 99.69\% recall, and 98.91\% precision in {CPSC}-{DB}, which is the best R-peak detection performance ever achieved.

The Bessel basis, when used for representing the {RR}-intervals, meaningfully enhances the pathologically induced low-frequency changes in terms of {FB} coefficients. To ensure the characterization of diverse pathological variability present in the {ECG} signals, time-frequency domain features are also extracted using scattering transform. The multi-label classification of the {ECG} signals, for five different lead combinations as mentioned in the Phys-{ioNet}/{CinC} Challenge 2021, is performed using Gated recurrent unit into specified twenty-six categories. We have participated in this Challenge as team “Medics”. Our code failed to run on the validation set during the official phase of the Challenge, hence our entry was not officially ranked in the Challenge. The experimental outcomes, for five-fold cross validation using 2021 {PhysioNet}/{CinC} Challenge dataset, demonstrates the mean Challenge scoring metric on the twelve-lead, six-lead, four-lead, three-lead, and two-lead combinations as 0.40, 0.43, 0.43, 0.44, and 0.45 respectively.

	abstract = {We introduce a new representation learning approach for domain adaptation, in which data at training and test time come from similar but different distributions. Our approach is directly inspired by the theory on domain adaptation suggesting that, for effective domain transfer to be achieved, predictions must be made based on features that cannot discriminate between the training (source) and test (target) domains. The approach implements this idea in the context of neural network architectures that are trained on labeled data from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain (no labeled target-domain data is necessary). As the training progresses, the approach promotes the emergence of features that are (i) discriminative for the main learning task on the source domain and (ii) indiscriminate with respect to the shift between the domains. We show that this adaptation behaviour can be achieved in almost any feed-forward model by augmenting it with few standard layers and a new gradient reversal layer. The resulting augmented architecture can be trained using standard backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent, and can thus be implemented with little effort using any of the deep learning packages. We demonstrate the success of our approach for two distinct classification problems (document sentiment analysis and image classification), where state-of-the-art domain adaptation performance on standard benchmarks is achieved. We also validate the approach for descriptor learning task in the context of person re-identification application.},

	abstract = {Decoder-only transformers are the backbone of the popular generative pre-trained transformer ({GPT}) series of large language models. In this work, we employ this framework to the analysis of clinical heart time-series data, to create two pre-trained general purpose cardiac models, termed {PPG}-{PT} and {ECG}-{PT}. We place a special emphasis on making both such pre-trained models fully interpretable. This is achieved firstly through aggregate attention maps which show that, in order to make predictions, the model focuses on similar points in previous cardiac cycles and gradually broadens its attention in deeper layers. Next, we show that tokens with the same value, which occur at different distinct points in the electrocardiography ({ECG}) and photoplethysmography ({PPG}) cycle, form separate clusters in high dimensional space. The clusters form according to phase, as the tokens propagate through the transformer blocks. Finally, we highlight that individual attention heads respond to specific physiologically relevent features, such as the dicrotic notch in {PPG} and the P-wave in {ECG}. It is also demonstrated that these pre-trained models are straightforward to fine-tune for tasks such as classification of atrial fibrillation ({AF}), and beat detection in photoplethysmography. For the example of {AF}, the fine-tuning took 11 minutes of computer time, and achieved the respective leave-one-subject-out {AUCs} of 0.99 and 0.93 for {ECG} and {PPG} within the {MIMIC} Perform {AF} dataset. In addition, the fine-tuned beat detector achieved a state-of-the-art F1 score of 98\%, as well as uniquely providing a beat confidence level which acts as a signal quality estimator. Importantly, the fine-tuned models for {AF} screening are also fully explainable, with attention shifting to regions in the context that are strongly indicative of atrial fibrillation.},

Among the types of arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation ({AF}) and atrial flutter ({AFL}), which are considered risk factors for development due to high morbidity and mortality. The early detection of {AF}/{AFL} is essential because their effects on the heart or complications appear after a considerable time. Electrocardiography ({ECG}) is a widely used screening method in primary care because of its low cost and convenience. {ECG} records the heart's electrical activity for a period of time via electrodes attached to the body. Owing to the development of computing power and interest in big data, attempts at deep learning ({DL}) have increased. The transformer was proposed by Google in 2017 and has achieved state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing. Various transformer-based models have been applied to various tasks beyond natural language processing and have shown promising prospects. However, there have been few cases of vision transformer ({ViT}) applications in {ECG} domain. It was difficult to determine whether {ViT} had sufficient influence in {ECG} domain. This study determined whether our extensive {ECG} dataset could make an {AF}/{AFL} diagnosis. We also confirmed whether the recently proposed {ViT} has {AF}/{AFL} diagnostic power.},

With the increase of time series data availability, hundreds of {TSC} algorithms have been proposed. Among these methods, only a few have considered Deep Neural Networks ({DNNs}) to perform this task. This is surprising as deep learning has seen very successful applications in the last years. {DNNs} have indeed revolutionized the field of computer vision especially with the advent of novel deeper architectures such as Residual and Convolutional Neural Networks. Apart from images, sequential data such as text and audio can also be processed with {DNNs} to reach state-of-the-art performance for document classification and speech recognition. In this article, we study the current state-of-the-art performance of deep learning algorithms for {TSC} by presenting an empirical study of the most recent {DNN} architectures for {TSC}. We give an overview of the most successful deep learning applications in various time series domains under a unified taxonomy of {DNNs} for {TSC}. We also provide an open source deep learning framework to the {TSC} community where we implemented each of the compared approaches and evaluated them on a univariate {TSC} benchmark (the {UCR}/{UEA} archive) and 12 multivariate time series datasets. By training 8730 deep learning models on 97 time series datasets, we propose the most exhaustive study of {DNNs} for {TSC} to date.},

State of the art machine learning algorithms have achieved remarkable results in classification of some heart conditions using {ECG} data, yet there appears to be no consensus on pre-processing best practices. Is this lack of consensus due to different conditions and architectures requiring different processing steps for optimal performance? Is it possible that state of the art deep-learning models have rendered pre-processing unnecessary? In this work we apply down-sampling, normalization, and filtering functions to 3 different multi-label {ECG} datasets and measure their effects on 3 different high-performing time-series classifiers. We find that sampling rates as low as 50Hz can yield comparable results to the commonly used 500Hz. This is significant as smaller sampling rates will result in smaller datasets and models, which require less time and resources to train. Additionally, despite their common usage, we found min-max normalization to be slightly detrimental overall, and band-passing to make no measurable difference. We found the blind approach to pre-processing of {ECGs} for multi-label classification to be ineffective, with the exception of sample rate reduction which reliably reduces computational resources, but does not increase accuracy.},

We have jointly optimized the entire multi-stage arrhythmia classification scheme based on 12-lead surface {ECGs} that attains the accuracy performance level of professional cardiologists. The new approach is comprised of a three-step noise reduction stage, a novel feature extraction method and an optimal classification model with finely tuned hyperparameters. We carried out an exhaustive study comparing thousands of competing classification algorithms that were trained on our proprietary, large and expertly labeled dataset consisting of 12-lead {ECGs} from 40,258 patients with four arrhythmia classes: atrial fibrillation, general supraventricular tachycardia, sinus bradycardia and sinus rhythm including sinus irregularity rhythm. Our results show that the optimal approach consisted of Low Band Pass filter, Robust {LOESS}, Non Local Means smoothing, a proprietary feature extraction method based on percentiles of the empirical distribution of ratios of interval lengths and magnitudes of peaks and valleys, and Extreme Gradient Boosting Tree classifier, achieved an F1-Score of 0.988 on patients without additional cardiac conditions. The same noise reduction and feature extraction methods combined with Gradient Boosting Tree classifier achieved an F1-Score of 0.97 on patients with additional cardiac conditions. Our method achieved the highest classification accuracy (average 10-fold cross-validation F1-Score of 0.992) using an external validation data, {MIT}-{BIH} arrhythmia database.

              Objective
              : Vast 12-lead {ECGs} repositories provide opportunities to develop new machine learning approaches for creating accurate and automatic diagnostic systems for cardiac abnormalities. However, most 12-lead {ECG} classification studies are trained, tested, or developed in single, small, or relatively homogeneous datasets. In addition, most algorithms focus on identifying small numbers of cardiac arrhythmias that do not represent the complexity and difficulty of {ECG} interpretation. This work addresses these issues by providing a standard, multi-institutional database and a novel scoring metric through a public competition: the {PhysioNet}/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2020.
              Approach
              : A total of 66 361 12-lead {ECG} recordings were sourced from six hospital systems from four countries across three continents; 43 101 recordings were posted publicly with a focus on 27 diagnoses. For the first time in a public competition, we required teams to publish open-source code for both training and testing their algorithms, ensuring full scientific reproducibility.
              Main results
              : A total of 217 teams submitted 1395 algorithms during the Challenge, representing a diversity of approaches for identifying cardiac abnormalities from both academia and industry. As with previous Challenges, high-performing algorithms exhibited significant drops (

              10\%) in performance on the hidden test data.
              Significance
              : Data from diverse institutions allowed us to assess algorithmic generalizability. A novel evaluation metric considered different misclassification errors for different cardiac abnormalities, capturing the outcomes and risks of different diagnoses. Requiring both trained models and code for training models improved the generalizability of submissions, setting a new bar in reproducibility for public data science competitions.},

	abstract = {The electrocardiogram ({ECG}) is a non-invasive representation of the electrical
activity of the heart from electrodes placed on the surface of the torso. The
standard 12-lead {ECG} has been widely used to diagnose a variety of cardiac
abnormalities such as cardiac arrhythmias, and predicts cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality
[[1]](http://www.onlinejacc.org/content/49/10/1109.abstract). The early and
correct diagnosis of cardiac abnormalities can increase the chances of
successful treatments
[[2]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/strokeaha.107.181486).
However, manual interpretation of the electrocardiogram is time-consuming, and
requires skilled personnel with a high degree of training
[[3]](https://www.magonlinelibrary.com/doi/abs/10.12968/bjca.2019.14.3.123).

Automatic detection and classification of cardiac abnormalities can assist
physicians in the diagnosis of the growing number of {ECGs} recorded. Over the
last decade, there have been increasing numbers of attempts to stimulate
12-lead {ECG} classification. Many of these algorithms seem to have the
potential for accurate identification of cardiac abnormalities. However, most
of these methods have only been tested or developed in single, small, or
relatively homogeneous datasets. The {PhysioNet}/Computing in Cardiology
Challenge 2020 provides an opportunity to address this problem by providing
data from a wide set of sources.},

	abstract = {In machine learning, if the training data is an unbiased sample of an underlying distribution, then the learned classification function will make accurate predictions for new samples. However, if the training data is not an unbiased sample, then there will be differences between how the training data is distributed and how the test data is distributed. Standard classifiers cannot cope with changes in data distributions between training and test phases, and will not perform well. Domain adaptation and transfer learning are sub-fields within machine learning that are concerned with accounting for these types of changes. Here, we present an introduction to these fields, guided by the question: when and how can a classifier generalize from a source to a target domain? We will start with a brief introduction into risk minimization, and how transfer learning and domain adaptation expand upon this framework. Following that, we discuss three special cases of data set shift, namely prior, covariate and concept shift. For more complex domain shifts, there are a wide variety of approaches. These are categorized into: importance-weighting, subspace mapping, domain-invariant spaces, feature augmentation, minimax estimators and robust algorithms. A number of points will arise, which we will discuss in the last section. We conclude with the remark that many open questions will have to be addressed before transfer learners and domain-adaptive classifiers become practical.},

We also present analysis on {CIFAR}-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks.

	abstract = {Domain adaptation ({DA}) and domain generalization ({DG}) have emerged as a solution to the domain shift problem where the distribution of the source and target data is different. The task of {DG} is more challenging than {DA} as the target data is totally unseen during the training phase in {DG} scenarios. The current state-of-the-art employs adversarial techniques, however, these are rarely considered for the {DG} problem. Furthermore, these approaches do not consider correlation alignment which has been proven highly beneficial for minimizing domain discrepancy. In this paper, we propose a correlation-aware adversarial {DA} and {DG} framework where the features of the source and target data are minimized using correlation alignment along with adversarial learning. Incorporating the correlation alignment module along with adversarial learning helps to achieve a more domain agnostic model due to the improved ability to reduce domain discrepancy with unlabeled target data more effectively. Experiments on benchmark datasets serve as evidence that our proposed method yields improved state-of-the-art performance.},

Beyond expanding this valuable resource, this paper offers pragmatic advice to anyone who may wish to evaluate a new algorithm on the archive.

	abstract = {In the last 5 years there have been a large number of new time series classification algorithms proposed in the literature. These algorithms have been evaluated on subsets of the 47 data sets in the University of California, Riverside time series classification archive. The archive has recently been expanded to 85 data sets, over half of which have been donated by researchers at the University of East Anglia. Aspects of previous evaluations have made comparisons between algorithms difficult. For example, several different programming languages have been used, experiments involved a single train/test split and some used normalised data whilst others did not. The relaunch of the archive provides a timely opportunity to thoroughly evaluate algorithms on a larger number of datasets. We have implemented 18 recently proposed algorithms in a common Java framework and compared them against two standard benchmark classifiers (and each other) by performing 100 resampling experiments on each of the 85 datasets. We use these results to test several hypotheses relating to whether the algorithms are significantly more accurate than the benchmarks and each other. Our results indicate that only nine of these algorithms are significantly more accurate than both benchmarks and that one classifier, the collective of transformation ensembles, is significantly more accurate than all of the others. All of our experiments and results are reproducible: we release all of our code, results and experimental details and we hope these experiments form the basis for more robust testing of new algorithms in the future.},

	abstract = {Background
Deep learning ({DL}) has shown promising results in improving atrial fibrillation ({AF}) detection algorithms. However, these models are often criticized because of their “black box” nature.
Aim
To develop a morphology based {DL} model to discriminate {AF} from sinus rhythm ({SR}), and to visualize which parts of the {ECG} are used by the model to derive to the right classification.
Methods
We pre-processed raw data of 1469 {ECGs} in {AF} or {SR}, of patients with a history {AF}. Input data was generated by normalizing all single cycles ({SC}) of one {ECG} lead to {SC}-{ECG} samples by 1) centralizing the R wave or 2) scaling from R-to- R wave. Different {DL} models were trained by splitting the data in a training, validation and test set. By using a {DL} based heat mapping technique we visualized those areas of the {ECG} used by the classifier to come to the correct classification.
Results
The {DL} model with the best performance was a feedforward neural network trained by {SC}-{ECG} samples on a R-to-R wave basis of lead {II}, resulting in an accuracy of 0.96 and F1-score of 0.94. The onset of the {QRS} complex proved to be the most relevant area for the model to discriminate {AF} from {SR}.
Conclusion
The morphology based {DL} model developed in this study was able to discriminate {AF} from {SR} with a very high accuracy. {DL} model visualization may help clinicians gain insights into which (unrecognized) {ECG} features are most sensitive to discriminate {AF} from {SR}.},

	abstract = {Atrial fibrillation ({AF}) is the most common heart arrhythmia, and 12-lead electrocardiogram ({ECG}) is regarded as the gold standard for {AF} diagnosis. Highly accurate diagnosis of {AF} based on 12-lead {ECG} is valuable and remains challenging. In this paper, we proposed a novel method with high accuracy for {AF} detection based on deep learning. The proposed method constructed a novel one-dimensional deep densely connected neural network ({DDNN}) to detect {AF} in {ECG} waveforms with a length of 10s. A large set of 16,557 12-lead {ECG} recordings collected from multiple hospitals and wearable {ECG} devices were used to evaluate the performance of the {DDNN}. In the test dataset (3312 12-lead {ECG} recordings), the {DDNN} obtained high performance with an accuracy of 99.35 ± 0.26\%, a sensitivity of 99.19 ± 0.31\%, and a specificity of 99.44 ± 0.17\%. Its high performance and automatic nature both demonstrate that the proposed network has a great potential to be applied to clinical computer-aided diagnosis of {AF} or future screening of {AF} in wearable devices.},

	abstract = {This study was to assess the feasibility of using non-standardized single-lead electrocardiogram ({ECG}) monitoring to automatically detect atrial fibrillation ({AF}) with special emphasis on the combination of deep learning based algorithm and modified patch-based {ECG} lead. Fifty-five consecutive patients were monitored for {AF} in around 24 hours by patch-based {ECG} devices along with a standard 12-lead Holter. Catering to potential positional variability of patch lead, four typical positions on the upper-left chest were proposed. For each patch lead, the performance of automated algorithms with four different convolutional neural networks ({CNN}) was evaluated for {AF} detection against blinded annotations of two clinicians. A total of 349,388 10-second segments of {AF} and 161,084 segments of sinus rhythm were detected successfully. Good agreement between patch-based single-lead and standard 12-lead recordings was obtained at the position {MP}1 that corresponds to modified lead {II}, and a promising performance of the automated algorithm with an R-R intervals based {CNN} model was achieved on this lead in terms of accuracy (93.1\%), sensitivity (93.1\%), and specificity (93.4\%). The present results suggest that the optimized patch-based {ECG} lead along by deep learning based algorithms may offer the possibility of providing an accurate, easy, and inexpensive clinical tool for mass screening of {AF}.},

	volume = {45},
	doi = {10.1093/eurheartj/ehae666.3497},
	abstract = {Artificial intelligence ({AI}), particularly deep learning ({DL}), has demonstrated high performance in various diagnostic problems, including the detection of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ({AF}) from electrocardiograms ({ECGs}). In mobile applications, these approaches can help to detect {AF} at an early stage and thus prevent possible secondary diseases. However, due to their black-box nature, {DL} approaches lack explainability and interpretability. Furthermore, 12-lead {ECGs} are the clinical standard, but mobile devices usually only provide 1–3 leads, which are similar but not identical to Einthoven leads and differ in morphology.We apply a recently introduced explainable {ECG} analysis architecture ({xECGArch}) to single-lead {ECGs} to verify its performance in mobile applications. {xECGArch} can learn rhythmic and morphological characteristics using two parallel convolutional neural networks of different dimensions (Fig. 1). When combined with methods from explainable {AI}, the classification can be traced back to rhythmic and morphological characteristics.We used a subset of 9 854 {ECGs} (n({AF}) = n(non-{AF}) = 4 927) from 4 public databases (Chapman-Shaoxing, {CPSC}2018, Georgia, and {PTB}-{XL}). Noise was removed using a cascade of high-pass filtering at 0.3 Hz and discrete wavelet transform. For each lead, we trained {xECGArch} on single-lead {ECGs} of 10 s length to classify {AF} vs. non-{AF} using 90\% of the {ECGs} with 5-fold cross-validation and tested it on the remaining randomly selected {ECGs} (n({AF}) = 507, n(non-{AF}) = 479). Consistent data splitting was ensured for all leads. Model explanations were generated using deep Taylor decomposition.Both models achieved minimum 91.1\% accuracy for each {ECG} lead (Fig. 1). On lead I, the morphology model outperformed the rhythm model with 92.8\% vs. 91.5\% accuracy, while the rhythm model slightly outperformed the morphology model on leads {II} and {III} with 94.2\%–95.0\% accuracy vs. 91.1\%–94.0\%. Both models achieved maximum accuracy of 95.0\% (rhythm) and 94.0\% (morphology) on lead {II}. By combining both models, {xECGArch} reached 93.7\%–95.1\% accuracy. The model explanations confirm that the rhythm model primarily considers {QRS} complexes as relevant, while the morphology model focuses on fibrillatory waves (Fig. 1).Both rhythm and morphology models achieved reliable results across all leads, competing with the state-of-the-art for automatic {AF} detection from single-lead {ECGs}. The combination of both models in {xECGArch} further increased the accuracy. {xECGArch} is based on the medical reading of {ECGs} by considering rhythm and morphology characteristics and is therefore interpretable by design. The model explanations are consistent with the diagnostic criteria for {AF} (Fibrillatory waves and absolute arrhythmia) across leads. With high accuracy on different single-lead {ECGs} and improved interpretability, {xECGArch} provides a trustworthy method for {ECG} analysis in mobile applications.},

            Atrial fibrillation ({AF}) and atrial flutter ({AFL}) are cardiac arrhythmias associated with high morbidity and mortality. This cross-sectional observational study assesses the epidemiological burden of {AF}/{AFL} concerning metabolic risk factors using the Global Burden of Disease ({GBD}) 2021 database. Age-standardized disability-adjusted life years rate ({ASDR}), mortality, and estimated annual percentage change were calculated. The Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort model was utilized to predict future trends in {ASDR} and age-standardized mortality rate ({ASMR}) for {AF}/{AFL} 2030. Between 1990 and 2021, {ASDR} rose from 34.22 to 34.94, whereas {ASMR} increased from 1.46 to 1.50 per 100,000 people. High/high–middle Socio-Demographic Index ({SDI}) regions showed decreasing trends in {ASDR} and {ASMR}, whereas low and middle {SDI} regions showed increasing trends. In 2021, the highest {ASDR} and {ASMR} were recorded in Australasia, North America, and Western Europe, with significant country-level variability. Projections indicate a declining trend in {ASMR} and stable {ASDR} through 2030. The global rise in {AF}/{AFL} attributable to metabolic risk factors necessitates comprehensive and region-specific public health strategies. Further research is warranted to develop and implement effective measures to mitigate these conditions and improve cardiovascular health outcomes worldwide.},
